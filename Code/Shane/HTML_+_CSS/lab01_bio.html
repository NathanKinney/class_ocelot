            <h1>The Comic That Started It all</h1>
            <p class="my_p_text">Action Comics #1 (cover dated June 1938) is the first issue of the original run of the comic book series Action Comics. It features the first appearance of several comic book heroesâ€”most notably the Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster creation, Superman and sold for 10 cents (equivalent to $2 in 2017). It is widely considered to be both the beginning of the superhero genre and the most valuable comic book in the world. Action Comics would go on to run for 904 numbered issues (plus additional out-of-sequence special issues) before it restarted its numbering in the fall of 2011. It returned to its original numbering with issue #957, published on June 8, 2016 (cover-dated August).

    On August 24, 2014, a copy graded 9.0 by CGC was sold on eBay for US$3,207,852.[3] It is the only comic book to have sold for more than $3 million for a single original copy.[3]</p>
            <h1>Superman</h1>
            <p class = my_p_text>In January 1933, Jerry Siegel wrote a short prose story titled "The Reign of the Superman", which was illustrated by his friend Joe Shuster and self-published in a science fiction magazine. It told the story of a bald villain with telepathic powers. Trying to create a character they could sell to newspaper syndicates, Siegel re-conceived the "superman" character as a powerful hero, sent to our world from a more advanced society. He and Shuster developed the idea into a comic strip, which they pitched unsuccessfully.</p>
