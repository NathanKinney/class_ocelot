        <p class="my_text"><ls></ls>l>Action Comics #1 (cover dated June 1938) is the first issue of the original run of the comic book series Action Comics. It features the first appearance of several comic book heroes—most notably the Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster creation, Superman—and sold for 10 cents (equivalent to $2 in 2017). It is widely considered to be both the beginning of the superhero genre and the most valuable comic book in the world. Action Comics would go on to run for 904 numbered issues (plus additional out-of-sequence special issues) before it restarted its numbering in the fall of 2011. It returned to its original numbering with issue #957, published on June 8, 2016 (cover-dated August).

On August 24, 2014, a copy graded 9.0 by CGC was sold on eBay for US$3,207,852.[3] It is the only comic book to have sold for more than $3 million for a single original copy.[3]</p>
