               I.\
\
    Twas dark; from every mountain head\
    The sunny smile of heaven had fled,\
    And evening, over hill and dale\
    Dropt, with the dew, her shadowy veil;\
    In fabled Teios darkening tide\
        Was quenched the golden ray;\
    Silent, the silent stream beside,\
    Three gallant peoples hope and pride,\
        Three gallant armies lay.\
    France, every nations foe, is there,\
    And Albions sons her red cross bear,\
    With Spains young Liberty to share\
        The patriot array,\
    Which, spurning the oppressors chain,\
    Springs armd, from every hill and plain\
    From ocean to the eastern main--\
        From Seville to Biscaye.\
    All, from the dawn till even-tide,\
    The fortune of the field had tried\
        In loose but bloody fray;\
    And now with thoughts of dubious fate\
    Feverish and weary, they await\
        A fiercer, bloodier day.\
\
\
               II.\
\
    Fraternal Frances chosen bands\
    He of the stolen crown commands,\
    And on Alberche\'s hither sands\
        Pitches his tents to-night:\
    While, Talaveras wall between\
    And olive groves and gardens green,\
        Spain quarters on the right;\
    All scatterd in the open air\
    In deep repose; save here and there,\
        Pondering to-morrows fight,\
    A spearman, in his midnight prayer,\
    Invokes our Blessed Ladys care\
        And good Saint Jamess might.\
    Thence to the left, across the plain\
        And on the neighbouring height,\
    The British bands, a watchful train,\
    Their wide and warded line maintain,\
    Fronting the east, as if to gain\
        The earliest glimpse of light.\
\
\
               III.\
\
    While there, with toil and watching worn,\
    The Island warriors wait the morn,\
        And think the hours too slow;\
    Hark!--on the midnight breezes borne\
        Sounds from the vale below!\
    What sounds? No gleam of arms they see,\
    Yet still they hear--What may it be?\
        It is, it is the foe!\
    From every hand and heart and head--\
    As quick was never lightning sped--\
    Weakness and weariness are fled;\
        And down the mountain steeps,\
    Along the vale, and through the shade,\
    With ball and bayonet and blade,\
    They seek the foe who dares invade\
        The watch that England keeps.\
    Nor do the dauntless sons of France\
    Idly await the hot advance:--\
        As active and as brave\
    Thrice rush they on, and thrice their shock\
    Rebounding breaks, as from the rock\
        Is dashd the wintry wave.\
\
\
               IV.\
\
    But soon the darkling armies blend,\
    Promiscuous death around they send,\
    Foe falls by foe and friend by friend\
        In mingled heaps oerthrown:\
    And many a gallant feat is done,\
    And many a laurel lost and won,\
        Unwitnessd and unknown;--\
    Feats, that achieved in face of day,\
    Had fired the bards enthusiast lay,\
    And, in some holy aisle, for aye\
        Had lived in sculptured stone.\
    Oh, for a blaze from heaven, to light\
    The wonders of that gloomy fight,\
        The guerdon to bestow,\
    Of which the sullen envious night\
        Bereaves the warriors brow!\
    Furious they strike without a mark,\
    Save where the sudden sulphurous spark\
    Illumes some visage grim and dark,\
        That with the flash is gone!\
    And, midst the conflict, only know,\
    If chance has sped the fatal blow,\
    Or by the trodden corse below,\
        Or by the dying groan.\
\
\
               V.\
\
    Far oer the plain, and to the shores\
    Of Teio and Alberche, roars\
        The tumult of the fight;\
    The distant camps, alarmed, arise;\
    And throbbing hearts, and straining eyes\
    Watch, through the dull and vapoury skies,\
        The portents of the night--\
    The vollying peals, terrific cries,\
        And gleams of lurid light--\
    But all is indistinct:--in vain\
    The anxious crowds their senses strain,\
        And, in the flash or shout,\
    Fancy they catch the signal plain\
        Of victory or rout:--\
    The signal dies away again,\
    And the still, breathless crowds remain\
        In darkness and in doubt.\
\
\
               VI.\
\
    Thus rolld the short yet lingering night\
        Its clouds oer hill and dale;\
    But when the morning showd in light\
    The wreck of that tempestuous fight\
        Scatterd along the vale;\
    Still seated on her trophied height,\
    Britain exulted at the sight,\
        And Frances cheek grew pale.\
    Lords of the field, the victors view\
    Ten gallant French the turf bestrew\
        For every Briton slain:\
    They view, with not unmingled pride;\
    Some anxious thoughts their souls divide--\
        Their throbbing hopes restrain;\
    Hundreds beneath their arm have died,\
        But myriads still remain:\
    A sterner strife must yet be tried,\
    A more tempestuous day decide\
        The wavering fates of Spain.\
\
\
               VII.\
\
    From the hill summit they behold,\
    By the first beams of orient gold\
        In adverse arms reveald,\
    Full fifty thousand warriors bold,\
    Inured to war, in conquest old,\
        To toil and terror steeld:\
    But they,--as steeld to fear or toil,\
    As bold, as proud of war-won spoil,\
        In victorys path as skilld,\
    Though doomed with twice their strength to try\
        The hard unequal field,\
    They view the foe with kindling eye,\
    And, in their generous transport, cry\
    \'Conquer we may--perhaps must die;\
         But never, never yield!\'\
\
\
               VIII.\
\
    Thus ardent they: but who can tell,\
    In Wellesleys heart what passions swell?\
    What cares must agitate his mind,\
    What wishes, doubts, and hopes combined,\
    Whom with his countrys chosen bands,\
    Midst cold allies, in foreign lands,\
        Outnumbering foes surround;\
    From whom that countrys jealous call\
    Demands the blood, the fame of all;\
    To whom twere not enough to fall,\
        Unless with victory crownd?\
    O heart of honour! soul of fire!\
    Even at that moment fierce and dire,\
        Thy agony of fame,\
    When Britains fortune dubious hung,\
    And France tremendous swept along\
        In tides of blood and flame;\
    Even while thy genius and thy arm\
    Retrieved the day, and turnd the storm\
        To Frances rout and shame,\
    Even at that moment, factious spite\
    And envious fraud conspired to blight\
        The honours of thy name!\
\
\
               IX.\
\
    He thinks not of them:--From that height\
    He views the scene of future fight,\
    And, silent and serene, surveys,\
    Down to the plain where Teio strays,\
    The woods, the streams, the mountain ways,\
        Each dell and sylvan hold:\
    Prescient of all the war, he knows\
    On wing or center, where the foes\
        May pour their fury most;\
    And marks what portion of the field\
    To their advance twere good to yield,\
        And what must not be lost.\
    And all his gallant chiefs around\
    Observant watch, where oer the ground\
        His eagle glance has rolled.\
    Few words he spake, or needed they,\
    Of counsel for the approaching fray,\
    Where to condense the loose array,\
        Or where the line unfold:\
    They saw, they felt what he would say,\
    And the best order of the day,\
        It was his eye that told.\
\
\
               X.\
\
    And is it now a goodly sight,\
        Or dreadful, to behold\
    The pomp of that approaching fight--\
    Waving ensigns, pennons light,\
    And gleaming blades and bayonets bright,\
        And eagles wingd with gold;--\
    And warrior bands of many a hue,\
    Scarlet and white and green and blue,\
    Like rainbows, oer the morning dew\
        Their varied tints unfold:\
    While swells the martial din around,--\
    And, starting at the bugles sound,\
    The tramping squadrons beat the ground,\
        And drums unceasing roll:\
    Frequent and long the warrior cheer,\
    To glorys perilous career\
        Awakes and fires the soul:\
    And oft, by fits confused and clear,\
    The din and clang, to fancys ear,\
        The knell of thousands toll.\
\
\
               XI.\
\
    Soon, soon shall vanish that array,\
    Those varied colours fade away\
        Like meteors light and vain,\
    And eagle bright and pennon gay,\
        Ensanguined dust distain:\
    And soon be hushd in various death,\
    The cymbals clang, the clarions breath,\
        The thunder of the plain:--\
    That sun which fires the eastern sky\
    Shall set, ere noon, to many an eye\
        In battles stormy main!\
    The young, the gay, the proud, the strong,\
    Ghastly and gored, shall lie along\
        In mingled carnage piled.\
    Blood shall pollute the limpid source,\
    And Teio flow, with many a corse\
        Affrighted and defiled.\
\
\
               XII.\
\
    But not alone by Teios shore,\
    Tho heapd with slain, and red with gore,\
        The tide of grief shall flow:--\
    Tis not amidst the din of fight,\
    Nor on the warriors crested height,\
        Death strikes his direst blow:--\
    Far from the fray, unseen and late,\
    Descend the bitterest shafts of fate,\
    Where tender love, and pious care\
    The lingering hours of absence wear\
        In solitude and gloom;\
    And, mingling many a prayer and tear,\
    Of sire, or child, or husband dear\
        Anticipate the doom:\
    Their hopes no trophied prospects cheer,\
        For them no laurels bloom;\
    But trembling hope, and feverish fear,\
    Forebodings wild, and visions drear\
        Their anguishd hearts consume.\
\
\
               XIII.\
\
    All tremble now, but not on all,\
    Poisond with equal woe, shall fall\
    The shaft of destiny:--to some\
    The dreadful tale of ill shall come,\
        Not unallayed with good;\
    And they, with mingled grief and pride,\
    Shall hear that in the battles tide\
    Their darling soldier sank and died;--\
        Died as a soldier should!\
    But in the rough and stormy fray,\
    Many are doomed to death to-day,\
    Whose fate shall neer at home be told,\
    Whose very names the grave shall fold;\
    Many, for whose return, in vain\
    The wistful eye of love shall strain,\
    In vain parental fondness sigh,\
    In cruel hope that neer can die,\
        And filial sorrow mourn--\
    On Talaveras plain they lie,\
        No! never to return!\
\
\
               XIV.\
\
    But, tyrant, thou, the cause of all\
    The blood that streams, the tears that fall,\
    Who, by no faith or fear confind,\
    In impious triumph oer mankind,\
        Thy desolating course hast driven,\
    Bursting the sacred ties that bind\
        Man to his fellow and to heaven!\
    All great and guilty as thou art,\
    Thou of the iron hand and heart,\
    Shalt suffer yet the vengeance due\
        To him, who swears but to betray,\
    Whose friendship aids but to undo,\
        And only smiles to slay!\
    The insatiate fiend who drives thee on\
        With treacherous hope elate,\
    From crime to crime, and throne to throne,\
    From Afric to the arctic zone,\
        But dupes thee to thy fate:\
    And Heavn which, by thy power oerthrown,\
    Will one day vindicate its own,\
        _Condemns_ thee to be great!\
    The tempest, now thy sport and pride,\
    The flood on which thy fortunes ride,\
        Presumptuous and blind,\
    Ceasing at Heavens command to roar,\
    Shall cast thee naked on the shore,\
    The hate, and what thou fearest more,\
        The jest of all mankind.\
    And in thy hour of parting pain,\
        The parents, widows, orphans moan,\
    The shrieking of the battle plain,\
        The strangled prisoners midnight groan,\
    Shall harrow up thy brain;\
    From countless graves, the ghastly crew\
    Shall burst upon thy frensied view--\
        Thou peopler of the tomb!\
    And, stern and silent midst their cries,\
    The murderd heir of Bourbon rise,\
        And through the shadowy gloom,\
    Shake the curst torches in thine eyes\
        That lighted to his doom!\
\
\
               XV.\
\
    But not to that tremendous hour\
    Does Heaven remit its torturing power;\
    And evn thy tyrant heart shall feel,\
    That _here_--that _now_--theres vengeance still!\
    In vain, thy gorgeous state would hide\
    Of conscious fear and wounded pride,\
        The self-inflicted pang;--\
    Though monarchs to thy car be tied,\
    Though over half the world beside,\
        Thy chains of conquest clang,--\
    Britain and Spain, erect and proud,\
    Defy thee to the strife aloud,\
    And wave to Europes servile crowd,\
        The flag of liberty:\
    In it, thou seest thy glorys shroud;\
    Its shadow, like a thunder cloud,\
        Oerhangs thy destiny.\
\
\
               XVI.\
\
    Yes, thou shalt learn--and, at the tale,\
    Thy pride shall shrink, thy hope shall fail,\
        Though falsehoods hand have tracd\
    The lying legend--thou shall know\
    Thy marshals foiled--thy thousands low--\
        Thy puppet King disgracd!\
    Far other thoughts their bosoms fill;\
    As now to Talaveras hill\
    Proud in their numbers and their skill,\
        The Gallic columns haste:\
    The same they are, and led by those,\
    The scourges of the worlds repose,\
    Victors of Milans fair domain,\
    Of Austerlitzs wintry plain,\
        And Friedlands sandy waste:\
    Who Prussias shiverd sceptre hurld\
    Down to the dust, and from the world\
        Her very name erased:\
    Who boast them, in presumptuous tone,\
    Each feat and fortune to have known\
    Of war, except _defeat_ alone;\
        But now of _that_ to taste!\
\
\
               XVII.\
\
    Valiant tho vain, tho boastful wise--\
    Marshals, and Dukes!--with skilful eyes\
        They view the adverse line;\
    And well their prudent councils weigh\
    The eventful danger of the day,\
        Where Britains banners shine.\
    \'What though the Spanish spear we foil,\
    Poor were the prize, and vain the toil:--\
    Nothing is done till Britains spoil\
        Attest our victory:\
    Till, on the wings of terror borne,\
    The Leopards, scattered and forlorn,\
        Fly to their guardian sea.\
    On then!--let _Britain_ prove our might!\
    _Hers_ be the trial of the fight,\
        The peril and the pain!\
    Press her with growing thousands round,\
    Dash that red banner to the ground,\
        And seal the fate of Spain!\
\
\
               XVIII.\
\
    Thus France her baseless vision forms:\
    But HE,--long tried in battle storms--\
        In Inds unequal war\
    Scattering, like dust, the sable swarms\
        Of Scindiah and Berar;\
    He, conqueror still whereer he turns,\
        On Zealands frozen reign,\
    Or where the sultry summer burns\
        Vimeros rocky plain;\
    Who, from his tyrant station shook,\
    With grasp of steel, Abrantes Duke;\
    HE, who from Douros rescued side,\
    Dispersed Dalmatias upstart pride;--\
    In fortune and desert, the same\
        On every scene of war,\
    Sebastianis pride shall tame;\
    And practised Jourdans veteran fame,\
    And Victor! thy portentous name\
        Shall fade before his star!\
\
\
               XIX.\
\
    In front of Talaveras wall,\
    And near the confluent streams, the Gaul\
    His royal banner rears to sight,\
    With all the borrowd blazon bright\
        Of Leon and Castille;\
    And seems to meditate a fight\
        That Spain alone shall feel.\
    Oh, vain pretence! to Wellesleys eyes,\
        As pervious as the air!\
    He knows, that while the red cross flies,\
    From the strong covert, where she lies\
    Entrenchd and shelterd, Spain defies\
        The utmost France can dare--\
    That Britain, on her blood-staind hill,\
        The brunt of fight must bear--\
    And France, though baffled thrice, will still\
    Strain all her force, exhaust her skill,\
        To plant her eagles there;\
    Which soon, from that commanding height\
    Would speed their desolating flight,\
    And, sweeping oer the scatterd plain,\
    The hopes of England and of Spain\
        With iron talon tear.\
\
\
               XX.\
\
    Now from the dark artillery broke\
    Lightning flash and thunder stroke;\
    And cloud on cloud of fiery smoke\
        Rolls in the darkend air:\
    Wrappd in its shade, unheard, unseen,\
    Artful surprise and onset keen\
        The crafty foes prepare--\
    Three columns of the flower of France\
    With rapid step and firm, advance,\
        At first thro tangled ground,\
    Oer fence and dell and deep ravine;\
    At length they reach the level green--\
    The midnight battles murderous scene--\
        The valleys eastern bound.\
    There in a rapid line they form,\
    Thence are just rushing to the storm\
        By bold Belluno led,\
    When sudden thunders shake the vale,\
    Day seems, as if eclipsed, to fail,\
        The light of heaven is fled;\
    A dusty whirlwind rides the sky,\
    A living tempest rushes by\
        With deafening clang and tread--\
    \'A charge! a charge! the British cry,\
        \'And Seymour at its head.\
\
\
               XXI.\
\
    Belluno sees the coming storm,\
        And feels the instant need--\
    \'Break up the line, the column form,\
        And break and form with speed,\
    Or under Britains thundering arm\
        In rout and ruin bleed!\
    Quick, as upon the sea-beat sands\
    Vanish the works of childish hands,\
        The lengthend lines are gone,\
    And broken into nimble bands\
        Across the plain they run:\
    \'Spur, Britain, spur thy foaming horse,\
    Oertake them in their scatterd course,\
        And sweep them from the land!\
    She spurs, she flies; in vain, in vain--\
    Already they have passd the plain,\
    And now the broken ground they gain,\
        And now, a column, stand!\
    \'Rein up thy courser, Britain, rein!--\
    But who the tempest can restrain?\
        The mountain flood command?\
    Down the ravine, with hideous crash,\
    Headlong the foremost squadrons dash,\
    And many a soldier, many a steed\
    Crushd in the dire confusion bleed.\
    The rest, as ruin fills the trench,\
    Pass clear, and on the columnd French,\
    A broken and tumultuous throng,\
    With glorious rashness pour along,\
        Too prodigal of life;\
    And they had died, ay every one,\
    But Wellesley cries, \'On, Anson, on,\
    Langworth, and Albuquerque and Payne,\
    Lead Britain, Hanover, and Spain,\
        And turn the unequal strife.\
\
\
               XXII.\
\
    Needs it to tell how fierce the flame\
        Burnd of that doubtful strife,\
    Whose precious prize was life, and fame\
        More precious still than life!--\
    By France what English hearts were gord,\
    What crests were cleft by Britains sword,\
    When horse and foot infuriate met,\
    And sabre clashd with bayonet,\
    And how they fought and how they fell,\
    And man and steed, midst shout and yell,\
        The field of carnage strewd:\
    It were a tedious tale to tell,\
        A tedious tale of blood.\
    But when the fierce and cloudless sun\
        Blazed from his noontide height,\
    And ere the field was lost or won,\
        Worn and unable quite\
    The hostile stroke to make or shun,\
    Faint, breathless, all with toil foredone,\
        They pausd amid the fight!\
    Oft, when the midnight tempests sweep\
    With fiercest fury oer the deep,\
    Short, sullen pauses intervene,\
    And, evry fitful gust between,\
        The stormy roar is stilld:\
    Thus was the rage of battle staid,\
    And clash of bayonet and blade\
        Subsided oer the field:\
    Hushd was the shout, the tumult laid,\
    And each receding line obeyd\
    The truce which weary nature made,\
        And mutual honour seald.\
\
\
               XXIII.\
\
    There is a brook, that from its source\
        High in the rocky hill,\
    Pours oer the plain its limpid course,\
    To pay to Teios monarch force\
        Its tributary rill;\
    Which, in the peaceful summer-tide,\
    The swarthy shepherd sits beside,\
    And loitering, as it rolls along\
    In cadence pours his rustic song--\
    Carol of love or pious chaunt,\
    Or tale of knight and giant gaunt,\
        And lady captive held;\
    Or strains, not fabled, of the war,\
    Where the great champion of Bivar\
        The Moorish pagan quelld.\
    But now, no shepherd loiters there--\
    He flies, with all his fleecy care,\
        To mountains high and far,\
    And starts, and breathless stops to hear\
    Borne on the breeze, and to his fear\
    Seeming, at every gust, more near,\
        The distant roar of war.\
\
\
               XXIV.\
\
    But on the streamlets margin green\
    Other than shepherd forms are seen;\
    And sounds, unlike the rustic song,\
    The troubled current rolls along;\
    When, of the cooling wave to taste,\
    From either host the warriors haste\
        With busy tread and hum:\
    You would have thought that streamlet bound\
    Were listed field or sacred ground\
        Where battle might not come.\
    So late in adverse contest tried,\
    So deep in recent carnage dyed,\
    To mutual honour they confide\
        Their mutual fates; nor shrink\
    To throw the cap and helm aside,\
    As, mingled oer the narrow tide,\
        They bend their heads to drink;\
    Or, natures feverish wants supplied,\
    Unarmd, unguarded, side by side,\
    Safe in a soldiers faith and pride\
        They rest them on the brink.\
    They speak not--in each others phrase\
    Unskilld--but yet the thoughts of praise,\
        And honour to unfold,\
    The heart has utterance of its own;\
    And ere the signal trump was blown,\
        And ere the drum had rolld,\
    The honest grasp of manly hands,\
    That common link of distant lands,\
    That sign which nature understands,\
        The generous feeling told:\
    The high and sacred pledge it gave,\
    That both were true, and both were brave,\
    And something added of regret,\
    At parting when so lately met,\
        And (not developed quite)\
    Some dubious hopes of meeting yet\
    As heaven their devious paths might set,\
        In friendship or in fight.\
\
\
               XXV.\
\
    But short the truce that they can keep--\
        For now the signals shrill\
    Sounding along, from plain and steep,\
    Longer forbid the fight to sleep;\
    Light from the ground the warriors leap,\
        And seize the rein and steel:\
    All armd, all ardent, all arrayd,\
        Again their weapons wield;\
    And echoing thro the livid shade,\
    The clash of bayonet and blade\
        Revives along the field.\
    The hurried fight from post to post,\
    Kindles, but on the center most,\
    Whence, hoping on a happier stage,\
    The renovated war to wage,\
        France now assails the hill,\
    And pours with aggregated rage\
        The storm of fire and steel;\
    Soon from the eye the hostile crowd\
        The gathering shade conceals,\
    While from its bosom, long and loud,\
    Like thunder from a vernal cloud,\
        The din of battle peals.\
\
\
               XXVI.\
\
    But when the freshening breezes broke\
    A chasm in the volumed smoke,\
    Busy and black was seen to wave\
        The iron harvest of the field,--\
        That harvest, which, in slaughter tilld,\
    Is gathered in the grave:--\
    And now before their mutual fires\
        They yield, and now advance;\
    And now tis Britain that retires,\
        And now the line of France:\
    They struggle long with changeful fate;\
        And all the battles various cries,\
    Now depressd and now elate,\
        In mingled clamours rise;\
    Till France at length before the weight\
        Of British onset flies:\
    \'Forward, the fiery victors shout,\
    \'Forward, the enemys in rout,\
        Pursue him and he dies!\
\
\
               XXVII.\
\
    Hot and impetuous they pursued,\
    And wild with carnage, drunk with blood,\
        Rushd on the plain below;\
    The wily Frenchman saw and stood--\
    Screend by the verges of the wood\
        He turnd him on the foe.\
    The gallant bands that guard the crown\
    Of England, led the battle down,\
        And, in their furious mood,\
    Thrice they essayd with onset fierce,\
    Thrice faild, collected France to pierce--\
        Still France collected, stood!\
    While full on each uncoverd flank\
    Cannon and mortar swept their rank,\
    And many a generous Briton sank\
        Before the dreadful blaze;\
    Yet midst that dreadful blaze and din\
        The fearless shout they raise,\
    And ever, as their numbers thin,\
    Fresh spirits rush unbidden in,\
    Thoughtless, but how the meed to win\
        Of peril and of praise.\
    And still, as with a blacker shade\
        Fortune obscures the day,\
    Commingled thro the fight they wade,\
    And hand to hand and blade to blade,\
    Their blind and furious efforts braid,\
    As if, still dark and disarrayd,\
        They fought the midnight fray.\
\
\
               XXVIII.\
\
    In vain.--New hopes and fresher force\
    Inspirit France, and urge her course,\
    A torrent, rapid, wild, and hoarse,\
        On Britains wavering train.\
    As when, before the wintery skies,\
    The struggling forests sink and rise,\
        And rise and sink again,\
    While the gale scatters as it flies\
        Their ruins oer the plain;\
    Before the tempest of her foes,\
    So England sank, and England rose,\
    And, though still rooted in the vale,\
    Strewd her rent branches on the gale.\
    Then, Wellesley! on thy tortured thought\
    With ripening hopes of glory fraught,\
        What honest anguish crost!\
    Oh, how thy generous bosom burnd,\
    To see the tide of victory turnd,\
        And Spain and England lost!--\
    Lost--but that, as the peril great\
    And rising with the storms of fate,\
        His rapid genius soars,\
    Sees, at a glance, his whole resource,\
    Drains from each stronger point its force,\
        And on the weaker pours:\
    Present whereer his soldiers bleed,\
        He rushes thro the fray,\
    And, (so the doubtful chances need,)\
    In high emprize and desperate deed,\
        Squanders himself away!\
\
\
               XXIX.\
\
    Now from the summit, at his call,\
        A gallant legion firm and slow\
    Advances on victorious Gaul;\
    Undaunted, though their comrades fall!\
        Unshaken, though their leaders low!\
    Fixd--as the high and buttressd mound\
    Which guards some leaguerd city round,\
    They stand unmoved--Behind them form\
    The scatterd fragments of the storm;\
    While on their sheltering front, amain\
    France drives, with all her thundering train,\
        Her full career of death:\
    But drives not long her full career,\
    For now, that living bulwark near,\
    Faultring between fatigue and fear\
        She stops and pants for breath:\
    That dubious pause, that wavering rest,\
    The Britons seize, and breast to breast\
    Opposing, havocs arm arrest,\
    And from the foes exulting crest,\
        Tear down the laurel wreath.\
\
\
               XXX.\
\
    Nor does the gallant foe resign,\
    Even while his hopes and strength decline,\
        A tame inglorious prize;--\
    Long, long on Britains rallied line\
        The deadly fire he plies;\
    Long, long where Britains banners shine\
        He vainly toils and dies!\
    Neer to a battles fiercer groan\
        Did mountain echo roar,\
    Nor ever evening blush upon\
        A redder field of gore.\
    But feebler now, and feebler still,\
    The panting French assail the hill,\
    And weaker grows their cannons roar,\
    And thinner falls their missile shower,\
        Fainter their clanging steel;\
    The hot and furious fit is oer,\
    They shout--they charge--they stand no more--\
    And staggering in the slippery gore,\
        Their very leaders reel.\
\
\
               XXXI.\
\
    But shooting high and rolling far,\
    What new and horrid face of war\
        Now flushes on the sight?\
    Tis France, as furious she retires,\
    That wreaks, in desolating fires,\
        The vengeance of her flight.\
    Already parchd by summers sun,\
    The grassy vale the flames oer-run;\
        And, sweeping wreathd and light\
    Before the wind, the thickets seize,\
    And climb the dry and withered trees,\
        In flashes long and bright.\
    Oh! twas a scene sublime and dire,\
    To see that billowy sea of fire,\
        Rolling its flaky tide\
    Oer cultured field and tangled wood,\
    And drowning in the flaming flood\
        The seasons hope and pride!\
\
\
               XXXII.\
\
    From Talaveras wall and tower\
        And from the mountains height,\
    Where they had stood for many an hour\
        To view the varying fight,\
    Burghers and peasants in amaze\
    Behold their groves and vineyards blaze:\
    Calm they had viewd the bloody fray,\
        And little thought that Frances groan\
    And Englands sigh, ere close of day,\
        Should mingle with their own!\
    But ah! far other cries than these\
    Are wafted on the dismal breeze--\
    Groans, not the woundeds lingering groan--\
    Shrieks, not the shriek of death alone--\
        But groan, and shriek, and yell,\
    Of terror, torture, and despair;\
    Such as twould chill the heart to hear\
        And freeze the tongue to tell--\
    When to the very field of fight,\
    Dreadful alike in sound and sight,\
        The conflagration spread,\
    Involving in its fiery wave\
    The brave and reliques of the brave--\
        The dying and the dead!\
\
\
               XXXIII.\
\
    And now again the evening sheds\
        Her dewy veil on Teios side,\
    And from the Sierras rocky heads\
        The giant shadows stride;\
    And all is dim and dark again--\
    Save here and there upon the plain,\
        Still flash the baleful fires,\
    Across the umberd face of night\
    Casting a dull and flickering light,\
        As if from funeral pyres.\
    But since the close of yester-een\
    How alterd is the martial scene!\
    Again, in nights surrounding veil,\
        France moves her busy bands--but now\
    She comes not, venturous, to assail\
    The victors in their guarded vale,\
        Or on the mountains brow--\
    Dashd from her triumphs windy car\
    She mourns the wayward fate of war,\
    And baffled and disheartend, oer\
    Alberches stream and from his shore,\
        With silent haste she speeds,\
    Nor dares, evn at that midnight hour,\
        To snatch the rest she needs;\
    Far from the field where late she fought--\
        The tents where late she lay--\
    With rapid step and humbled thought,\
        All night she holds her way:\
    Leaving, to Britains conquering sons,\
    Standards rent and ponderous guns,\
        The trophies of the fray!\
    The weak, the wounded, and the slain--\
    The triumph of the battle plain--\
        The glory of the day!\
\
\
               XXXIV.\
\
    I would not check the tender sigh,\
        Nor chide the pious tear,\
    That heaves the heart and dims the eye\
        For friend or kinsman dear;\
    Evn when their honoured reliques lie\
        On victorys proudest bier;\
    But I would say, for those that die\
        In honours high career,\
    For those in glorys grave who sleep,\
    Weep fondly, but, _exulting_, weep!\
    More freshly from the untimely tomb\
    Renowns eternal laurels bloom\
        With sullen cypress twined.\
    Fortune is fickle and unsure,\
    And worth and fame to be secure\
        Must be in death enshrind!\
\
\
               XXXV.\
\
    I too have known what tis to part\
    With the first inmate of my heart--\
    To feel the bonds of nature riven--\
        To witness oer the glowing dawn,\
    The spring of youth, the fire of heaven,\
        The graves deep shadows drawn!\
    He sleeps not on the gory plain\
        The slumber of the brave--\
    Dear Victim of disease, and pain,\
    Where high Madeiras summits reign\
        Far oer the Atlantic wave,\
    He sought eluding health--in vain--\
    Health never lit his eye again,\
        He fills a foreign grave!\
    Oh, had he lived, his hand to-day\
        Had woven for the victors brow,\
    Such garland of immortal bay,\
    Such chaplet as the enraptured lay\
        Of genius may bestow!\
    Or,--since twas Heavens severer doom\
    To snatch him to an earlier tomb--\
    Would, Wellesley, would that he had died\
    Beneath thine eye and at thy side!\
    It would have lightend sorrows load,\
    Had thy applause on him bestowd\
        The fame he loved in thee;\
    And reard his honoured tomb beside\
    Those of the gallant hearts who died,\
    Their kinsmens, friends, and countrys pride,\
        In Talaveras victory!\

ODE\
\
     SUNG AT THE DINNER GIVEN BY THE GENTLEMEN FROM INDIA TO\
     FIELD-MARSHAL THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON, K.G. MONDAY, JULY 11, 1814.\
\
\
               I.\
\
    Victor of Assayes orient plain;--\
    Victor of all the fields of Spain;--\
    Victor of Frances despot reign;--\
        Thy task of glory done!\
    Welcome!--from dangers greatly dared;\
    From triumphs, with the vanquishd shared;\
    From nations saved, and nations spared;\
        Unconquerd Wellington!--\
\
\
               II.\
\
    _Unconquerd!_ yet thy honours claim\
    A nobler, than a Conquerors, name;--\
    At the red wreaths of guilty fame\
        Thy generous soul had blushd:\
    The blood--the tears the world has shed--\
    The throngs of mourners--piles of dead--\
    The grief--the guilt--are on _his_ head,\
        The Tyrant thou hast crushd.\
\
\
               III.\
\
    Thine was the sword which Justice draws;\
    Thine was the pure and generous cause,\
    Of holy rites and human laws\
        The impious thrall to burst;\
    And _thou_ wast destind for thy part!\
    The noblest mind, the firmest heart,\
    Artless--but in the warriors art--\
        And in that art, the first.\
\
\
               IV.\
\
    And WE, who in the eastern skies\
    Beheld thy Sun of glory rise,\
    Still follow, with exulting eyes,\
        His proud Meridian height.\
    Late,--on thy grateful countrys breast,\
    Late, may that Sun descend to rest,\
    Beaming through all the glowing West\
        The memory of his light.\

WAR SONG.\
\
1803.\
\
\
    Wave, wave, the banners of the fight;\
    Be every breast in armour dight,\
        And every soul on fire!\
    To trembling Europes frighted eyes,\
    Red let the sun of battle rise;\
    And bloody be the morning skies\
        That bring the day of ire!\
\
    Whose impious voice, from his dark cave\
    Wakes the destroyer of the brave?\
        What hand prepares their tomb?\
    Tis He, Ambitions perjured sprite,\
    Tis He, that waves the flags of fight,\
    Tis He, in clouds of deadliest night,\
        Who weaves the warriors doom.\
\
    Weep, weep, ye gentle dames of France,\
    Ye, whose devoted sons advance\
        To Britains fatal shore:\
    O! kiss their lips before ye part,\
    O! press them to your bursting heart--\
    Save in a dreams convulsive start--\
        Ye neer shall clasp them more.\
\
    Arouse, arouse, ye British dames,\
    With words of fire, the patriot flames\
        That burn for glorious deed.\
    For him that lives, the rapturd eye\
    Of love shall dance! for those who die,\
    Their ladies tears, their countrys sigh,\
        Shall be the sacred meed!\

TRAFALGAR.\

1805.\
\
\
               I.\
\
    Though I do love my countrys weal\
      As well as any soul that breathes;\
    Though more than filial pride I feel\
      To see her crownd, with conquring wreaths;\
\
    Yet from my heart do I deplore\
      Her recent triumphs on the main--\
    Those laurels dripping red with gore--\
      That victory bought with NELSON slain.\
\
    Oh! dearest conquest, heaviest loss,\
      That Englands hope and heart have known\
    Since first, in fight, her blood-red cross\
      Oer the great deep triumphant shone.--\
\
    And she should wail that conquest dear,\
      And she that heavy loss should mourn;\
    Hallow with sighs her Heros bier,\
      And gem with tears her Heros urn.\
\
    Shame on the wild and callous rout\
      That lights for joy its countless fires,\
    That hails the day with maddning shout,\
      While HE, who won the day, expires!\
\
    It was, indeed, a glorious day,--\
      And every homage of the heart\
    Were just, that rescued realms can pay,\
      Had NELSON lived to share his part.\
\
    Had NELSON lived to hear our praise,\
      I too had hymnd the victors song;\
    I too had lit the joyous blaze,\
      And wildly joind the exulting throng.\
\
    But HE is blind to pageant gay,\
      And he is deaf to joyous strain;\
    And I will raise no pleasant lay,\
      And swell no pomp for NELSON slain.\
\
    But I will commune with my mind,\
      To celebrate its darling Chief\
    What worthiest tribute it may find\
      Of softend pride, of temperd grief.\
\
    Ye good and great, tis yours to raise\
      The storied vase, the column tall,\
    Through every future age to praise\
      His life, and consecrate his fall:\
\
    Mine it will be, (oh! would my tongue\
      Were gifted with immortal verse!)\
    To strew, with many a sorrowing song,\
      Parnassian cypress oer his hearse.\
\
\
               II.\
\
    The fight was long;--and deep in blood\
    Britains triumphant warriors stood:\
    High oer the wave, untorn, unstaind,\
    The ensigns of her glory reignd:\
    Around, the wreckd and vanquishd pride\
    Of hostile navies strewd the tide;\
    Or scatterd, as the tempest bore,\
    Their ruins on the affrighted shore.\
\
    The haughty hopes of France and Spain,\
        Had dreamd of conquests laurel crown--\
    O! vision, arrogant and vain!--\
    NELSON has swept them from the main,\
        And dashd their airy trophies down:\
    Their fancied wreaths his brow adorn,\
    Won by his valour, in his triumph worn.\
\
    But, hark! amidst the joyous shout,\
    For Spains defeat, and Frances rout:\
    But, hark! amidst the glad acclaim\
    Of Englands honour, NELSONS fame,\
    What deep and sullen sounds arise?\
    Are these, alas! victorious cries?\
    Bode they a widowd nations woe;\
    The triumph vain, and NELSON low?--\
\
    In his full glorys brightest blaze,\
        On the high summit of his deeds,\
    (While Victorys saintly halo plays,\
    With living fire,--immortal rays,--\
        Around his head,) the Hero bleeds;\
    In pomp of death, to mortal eyes\
    Never before revealed, the Hero dies.\
\
    He dies! but while on Egypts strand\
    The Ptolomean tower shall stand;--\
    Staind with the turbid streams of Nile,\
    While seas shall beat Aboukirs isle;--\
    While the white ocean breaks and roars\
    On Trafalgars immortal shores;--\
    While high St. Vincents towery steep\
    And, giant of the Atlantic deep,\
    Dark Teneriffe, like beacons, guide\
      The wanderers of the western wave;\
    Sublime shall stand, amid the tide\
    Of baffled Time,--his countrys pride--\
        The sacred memory of the brave;\
      And NELSONS emulated name\
    Shine the proud sea-mark to the ports of Fame!\
\
\
               III.\
\
    Twas at the close of that dark morn\
        On which our Hero, conquering, died,\
    That every seamans heart was torn\
        By strife of sorrow and of pride;--\
\
    Of pride, that one short day would show\
        Deeds of eternal splendour done,\
    Full twenty hostile ensigns low,\
        And twenty glorious victories won--\
\
    Of grief, of deepest, tenderest grief,\
        That He, on every sea and shore,\
    Their brave, beloved, unconquerd Chief,\
        Should wave his victor-flag no more.\
\
    Sad was the eve of that dire day:\
        But direr, sadder was the night;\
    When human rage had ceased the fray,\
        And elements maintaind the fight.\
\
    All shaken in the conflict past\
        The navies feard the tempest loud--\
    The gale, that shook the groaning mast--\
        The wave, that climbd the tatterd shroud.\
\
    By passing gleams of sullen light,\
        The worn and weary seamen viewd\
    The hard-earnd prizes of the fight\
        Sink, foundring, in the midnight flood:\
\
    And oft, as drowning screams they heard,\
        And oft, as sank the ships around,\
    Some British vessel lost they feard,\
        And mournd some British brethren drownd.\
\
    And oft they cried, (as memory rolld\
        On Him, so late their hope and guide\
    But now a bloody corse and cold,)\
        \'Was it for _this_, that NELSON died?\
\
    For three short days, and three long nights,\
        They wrestled with the tempests force;\
    And sank the trophies of their fights,--\
        And thought upon that bloody corse!--\
\
    But when the fairer morn arose\
        Bright oer the yet-tumultuous main,\
    They saw no wreck but that of foes,\
        No ruin but of France and Spain:\
\
    And, victors now of winds and seas,\
        Beheld the British vessels brave\
    Breasting the ocean at their ease,\
        Like sea-birds on their native wave:\
\
    And now they cried, (because they found\
        Old Englands fleet in all its pride,\
    While Spains and Frances hopes were drownd,)\
        \'It _was_ for _this_ that NELSON died!\
\
    He died, with many an hundred bold\
        And honest hearts as ever beat!--\
    But wheres the British heart so cold\
        That would not die in such a feat?\
\
    Yes! by their memories! by all\
        The honours which their tomb surround!\
    Theirs was the noblest, happiest fall\
        Which ever mortal courage crownd.\
\
    Then bear them to their glorious grave\
        With no weak tears, no womans sighs;\
    Theirs was the death-bed of the brave,\
        And manly be their obsequies!\
\
    Haul not your colours from on high,\
        Nor down the flags of victory lower:--\
    Give every streamer to the sky,\
        Let all your conqring cannon roar;\
\
    That every kindling soul may learn\
        How to resign its patriot breath;\
    And from a grateful country, earn\
        The triumphs of a trophied death.\
\
\
               IV.\
\
    Rear high the monumental stone!--\
    To other days, as to his own,\
    Belong the Heros deathless deeds,\
    Who greatly lives, who bravely bleeds.\
\
    Not to a petty point of time\
    Or space, but wide to every clime\
    And age, his glorious fall bequeaths\
    Valours sword, and victorys wreaths.\
\
    The rude but pious care of yore\
    Heapd oer the brave the mounded shore;\
    And still that mounded shore can tell\
    Where Hector and Pelides fell.\
\
    There, over glorys earthly bed,\
    When many a wasting age had fled,\
    The worlds Great Victor pourd his prayrs\
    For fame, and monuments like theirs.\
\
    Happy the brave! whose sacred tomb\
    _Itself_ averts the oblivious doom,\
    Bears on its breast unfading bays,\
    And gives eternity of praise!\
\
    High, then, the monumental pile\
    Erect, for NELSON of the NILE!\
    Of TRAFALGAR, and VINCENTS heights,\
    For NELSON of the hundred fights--\
\
    For Him, alike on shore and surge,\
    Of proud Iberias power the scourge;\
    And half around the sea-girt ball,\
    The hunter of the recreant Gaul.\
\
    Rear the tall shaft on some bold steep\
    Whose base is buried in the deep;\
    But whose bright summit shines afar\
    Oer the blue ocean, like a star.\
\
    Such let it be, as oer the bed\
    Of Nilus rears its lonely head;\
    Which never shook at mortal might,\
    Till NELSON lanced the bolts of fight.\
\
    (What time the ORIENT, wrapt in fire\
    Blazed, its own seamens funeral pyre,\
    And, with explosive fury riven,\
    Sprang thundering to the midnight heaven.)\
\
    Around it, when the raven night\
    Shades ocean, fire the beacon-light;\
    And let it, thro the tempest, flame\
    The star of safety as of fame.\
\
    Thither, as oer the deep below\
    The seaman seeks his countrys foe,\
    His emulative eye shall roll,\
    And NELSONS spirit fill his soul.\
\
    Thither, shall youthful heroes climb,\
    The NELSONS of an after-time,\
    And, round that sacred altar, swear\
    Such glory and such graves to share.\
\
    Raise then, imperial Britain, raise\
    The trophied pillar of his praise;\
    And worthy be its towering pride,\
    Of those that live, of HIM that died!\
\
    Worthy of NELSON of the NILE!\
    Of NELSON of the cloud-cappd Isle,\
    Of TRAFALGAR and VINCENTS heights,\
    Of NELSON of the hundred fights!\
\

\
TO\
\
HIM\

WHO DESPAIRS OF SPAIN.\
\
1809.\
\
\
    Despair of Spain!--and dost _thou_ dare\
    To talk, cold plodder, of despair?\
        Dost _thou_ presume to scan\
    The proud revenge, the deathless zeal,\
    The throes that injured nations feel,\
        Beneath the oppressors ban;\
    The pride, the spirit, and the power,\
    That, growing with the arduous hour,\
        Ennoble patriot man?\
\
    O thou of little heart and hope,\
    Purblind diviner, can thy scope\
        Nothing but danger see?--\
    Unfrighted tho with carnage strewd,\
    Evn in her ruins unsubdued,\
        Great in adversity,\
    Do Saragossa and her train--\
    Heroes and Saints--survive in vain,\
    Shall they be told \'Despair of Spain,\
        And told, alas! by _thee_?\
\
    Oh, no; tho Frances murderous hand\
    Should sweep the desolated land,\
        _Revenge_ will still remain:--\
    Smotherd, but not extinguishd quite,\
    A spark will live, in time will light,\
        And fire the lengthening train.--\
    Stung by that pang which never dies,\
    Enthusiast millions shall arise,\
    And Europe echo to their cries,\
        NEVER DESPAIR OF SPAIN!\

\
NOTES\
\
TO\
\
THE BATTLE OF TALAVERA.\
\
\
STANZA II. line 1.--_Frances chosen bands._\
\
The force opposed to the allies comprised some of the \'e9lite of the\
French army.\
\
\
St. II. l. 2.--_He of the borrowed crown._\
\
    \'The _borrowed_ Majesty of England.\
              _Shakspeare, King John._\
\
Joseph (el Rey botilla) was in the field, and of course nominally\
commanding in chief; but he very prudently placed himself opposite to\
the Spanish lines, where there was little to do; and, accordingly, we do\
not hear of him again, till his gasconading proclamations from Saint\
Olalla, _after his retreat_.\
\
\
St. II. l. 5.--_Talavera._\
\
Talavera, (called de la Reyna, because it was for some time the\
_appanage_ of the Queens of Spain,) is one of the most ancient cities\
of the monarchy. Though situated nearly in the centre of the Peninsula,\
it has had the peculiar ill fortune of suffering in all ages, and from\
all parties, the calamities of war. Christians and Moors stormed and\
plundered it by turns, and not an instance occurs of an hostile force\
failing before it, till that one which I now attempt to describe. The\
ramparts were very strong, constructed of immense blocks of free-stone,\
and flanked, as it is said, with eighteen square towers; but the most\
ancient ramparts and towers have fallen into a state of dilapidation.\
The inhabitants themselves, indeed, have been more destructive even than\
Time, and, to procure stones for the erection of dwelling-houses, \'have\
industriously pillaged the dismantled walls, and reduced to an\
insignificant heap of stones all those stately fragments of majesty and\
strength, which had so long been preserved in Talavera as venerable\
monuments of its eventful history[1].\
\
The gate of the western suburb has been rendered memorable by a\
flagitious act of cruelty, committed in 1289, at the instigation of\
Sancho the Brave. On that spot were exposed to view the dissected limbs\
of 400 nobles of Talavera, who had been put to death for their adherence\
to the cause of the unfortunate family of La Cerda, against a successful\
usurper. This action is yet commemorated in the name of Puerto de\
Quartos. Talavera is now a considerable and opulent city, and must have\
been very populous even in 1289, since it could furnish 400 noble\
victims of one party.\
\
\
St. II. l. 13.--_St. James._\
\
St. James, or Saint Jago, is the Patron Saint of Spain. The shrine at\
Compostella, on the site of which the Apostles body was miraculously\
discovered in 800, became famous throughout Europe, and was for many\
ages the peculiar object of the liberality of the rich, and of the\
pilgrimages of the poor of all nations. In the year 1434, no less than\
2460 English had license from the King to proceed thither, with\
considerable sums of money, as well for offerings as for their necessary\
expenses.\
\
When Almanzor, the Moorish King of Seville, ravaged Gallicia, the divine\
interposition preserved, by a miraculous storm of lightning, the temple\
of Compostella from plunder and profanation. Is it too much to hope that\
the vengeance of Heaven may yet, in our days, visit invaders more\
rapacious, more cruel, more impious, than the Moors!\
\
\
St. III. l. 20.--_Thrice come they on._\
\
I have taken the liberty of representing the three attacks on General\
Hills position to have been all made about midnight, and in immediate\
succession, though, in fact, the first occurred late in the evening, the\
second only at midnight, and the third about day-break on the 28th.\
\
\
St. IV. l. 2.--_Promiscuous death._\
\
It is certain that in the confusion of the night-fight, much loss was\
occasioned on both parts, by mistaking friends for foes.\
\
\
St. IV. l. 9.--_The Bards enthusiast lay._\
\
   ---- sed omnes illacrimabiles\
    Urguentur ignotique long\'e2\
    Nocte, carent quia vate sacro.\
               _Hor. Od. 9, lib. 4._\
\
\
St. IV. l. 12.--_Oh for a blaze._\
\
A young and accomplished lady has discovered, as she fancies, a\
resemblance between the description of this night-fight, and that of the\
encounter of Tancred and Clorinda in the _Gierusalemme Liberata_. I am\
very far from agreeing with my fair critic in this notion, and any of my\
readers, who shall turn to the fifty-fourth and subsequent stanzas of\
the twelfth canto of the Jerusalem, will have the satisfaction, (not, I\
think, of detecting me in a presumptuous and unacknowledged imitation of\
Tasso,) but of reading one of the most striking passages of that\
splendid poem.\
\
\
St. VI. l. 23.--_Fifty thousand warriors._\
\
The French acknowledge to have had 45,000 men engaged, and we know that\
the effective British scarcely, if at all, exceeded 20,000.\
\
\uc0\u8258  Since these pages were first published, there have appeared in the\
Moniteur of Sept. 28, 1809, notes on Lord Wellingtons dispatches, which\
admit the disparity to have been still greater than the most sanguine\
Englishman had thought--than even _we romancers_ had imagined.\
\
They state the army which attacked Lord Wellesley, (as they call him,)\
to have consisted of the 1st and 4th corps, and the reserve; and their\
force they allege to have been,--the 1st corps, 36 battalions; the 4th,\
30 battalions; and the reserve, 20 battalions, exclusive of the cavalry,\
which was 40 squadrons. Now these 86 battalions, if complete, would have\
numbered about 60,000 infantry; and even if but _half_ complete, would\
have exceeded Lord Wellingtons force, (which they admit to have been\
but 20,000) by 10,000 of infantry alone, or, reckoning the cavalry, by\
14,000 men. But, in fact, they may be taken at 500 men to each battalion\
at least, that is, in the whole, at 43,000 infantry, and about 4,000\
cavalry. 1810.\
\
It is now known, that the French force consisted of about 50,000 men.\
1812.\
\
\
St. VIII. l. 6.--_Cold allies._\
\
The government and generals of Spain, at the period of the battle of\
Talavera, were more than usually tardy and feeble in all their measures.\
After the battle, Sir A. Wellesley was disabled from pursuing his\
advantages, and (when he was obliged, by General Cuestas extraordinary\
conduct, to retreat,) his army was almost exhausted, for want of those\
means of transport which the Spanish authorities had liberally promised\
him, and which, in fact, they could have furnished in sufficient\
abundance. While the guns taken at Talavera were in the possession of\
the English, the Spanish General could not be induced to afford the\
means of drawing them; but when, on this account, the English were\
forced to abandon them, the Spaniards easily found cattle for their\
conveyance. So, when the British army laid down its ammunition for want\
of means to carry it, the Spaniards found no difficulty in bringing it\
away for their own use[2]. The correspondence between Sir A. Wellesley,\
Lord Wellesley, and M. de Garay, in 1809, afford many similar proofs of\
the _coldness_ of the government of our allies; though it is now clear\
that it did not exist (as Sir J. Moore seems to have supposed) in all\
classes: the lower orders, and not a few of the higher, have all along\
exhibited irrefragable proofs of the warmest enthusiasm, and the most\
patriotic devotion. There have been, and there still are, a great number\
of persons in Spain, who, to say the best of them, are inclined to\
_temporize_; and too many of this class have found means to influence\
the national operations.--In spite of them, however, the spirit of the\
people may save their country; and I shall not despair, however\
\'Princes and Lords may flourish or may fade, of the cause of Spain,\
till \'the bold peasantry, its countrys pride, shall have passed under\
the usurpers yoke.\
\
\
St. VIII. l. 14.--_The agony of fame._\
\
This expression, and another in the last line of the XXVIIth Stanza, are\
borrowed from a splendid passage of Mr. Burkes, in which, speaking of\
Lord Keppel, he says, \'With what zeal and anxious affection I attended\
him through his trial, _that agony of his glory_--with what prodigality\
I _squandered_ myself in courting almost every sort of enmity for his\
sake, &c. _Burkes Works_, v. 8, p. 54.\
\
\
St. VIII. l. 21.--_Factious spite._\
\
The calumniators of Sir Arthur Wellesley have been so industrious in\
publishing their malignity, that it is unnecessary to recal to the\
public observation any particular instance of it. In reading their base\
absurdities, one cannot but recollect the expression of Marshal Villars\
(I think it was) to Lewis XIV. \'Sire, je vais combattre vos ennemis, &\
je vous laisse au milieu des miens.--Sir Arthur, much worse treated\
than M. de Villars, says nothing about it, but beats his countrys\
enemies, and despises his own.\
\
\
St. XIV. l. 1.--_But, tyrant, thou._\
\
With all the reluctance which one must feel to charge with atrocious\
crimes, a man whose talents (not always ill employed) have raised him to\
the highest station and power that any human being ever attained, it is\
yet impossible to think of his cruel and unprovoked attack on the\
Spanish crown and people without indignation--without feeling, that\
Divine Justice must charge to his account, all the ruin by fire, famine,\
and the sword, which his unparalleled injustice has visited upon that\
unhappy country.\
\
\
St. XIV. l. 23.--_The murderd heir of Bourbon._\
\
The seizing the Duke DEnghien in a neutral state, dragging him to a\
tribunal to which he was, in no view, amenable, condemning him by laws\
to which he owed no obedience, and finally, putting him to death by a\
hasty and cowardly execution by _torch-light_, are stains on\
Buonapartes character, of such violence, injustice, and cruelty, as no\
good fortune, no talents, no splendour of power, or even of merit, can\
ever obliterate.\
\
\
St. XV. l. 7.--_Self inflicted pang._\
\
   -------- Cur tamen hos tu\
    Evasisse putes, quos, diri conscia facti,\
    Mens habet attonitos, et surdo verbere c\'e6dit,\
    Occultum quatiente animo tortore flagellum?\
              _Juvenal, Sat. 13._\
\
\
St. XV. l. 11.--_Spain erect and proud._\
\
The author has feared to indulge any very sanguine hope of the final\
success of the Spanish cause, particularly since the retreat of the\
French from Madrid, and behind the Ebro, was turned to so little solid\
advantage by the Spaniards. But that their efforts and their example in\
a great degree have already crippled and distracted the power of France,\
and afforded a considerable chance for the emancipation of Europe; that\
the victories of Baylen and Talavera, the defence of Saragossa and\
Gerona, have been of one great advantage (exclusively of any other) in\
dissipating the spell of French invincibility, cannot be denied.\
Undoubtedly Buonaparte will come out of the Spanish contest, even though\
he should finally succeed in placing his brother on the throne, with\
diminished reputation and more precarious power. It is singular that in\
the succession war, a century ago, the French were obliged in like\
manner to retire from Madrid behind the Ebro, and that the negligence of\
the other party, in not dislodging them from that position, eventually\
placed the French competitor on the throne of Spain. _See Carletons\
Memoirs._ 1809.\
\
It is now upwards of two years since this note was written, and it must\
be confessed that the French cause is not now, to all appearance, in so\
promising a condition as it was then. Hopes that the author once\
considered as too sanguine, have been more than realized, and the final\
deliverance of Spain from the atrocious usurpation of France, seems\
every hour less improbable. 1812.\
\
\
St. XVII. l. 12.--_Leopards._\
\
This is an image which Buonaparte himself has chosen to use: \'When I\
shall shew myself (said his speech to the Legislative Body, in Dec.\
1809), \'beyond the Pyrenees, the _frightened leopard_ will fly to the\
ocean to avoid shame, defeat, and death.--This is bold; what follows\
might well be called by the coarser epithet which Doctor Bentley applied\
to the imitator of Pindar--\'The triumph of my arms will be the triumph\
of the genius of good over that of evil; of _moderation_, _order_, and\
_morality_, over civil war, anarchy, and the bad passions!!! My\
friendship and protection will, I hope, restore tranquillity and\
happiness to the people of the Spains!!!\
\
\
St. XVIII. l. 3.--_Inds unequal war._\
\
At Assaye, on the third of September, 1803, with 2,000 Europeans, and\
2,500 native troops, Sir Arthur Wellesley utterly defeated the united\
armies of Scindia and the Rajah of Berar, amounting to 20,000 cavalry,\
and at least 11,000 infantry, strongly posted, furnished with a\
formidable and well served train of artillery, (all taken,) and\
officered in a great degree by Frenchmen. On the 30th Nov. he again came\
up with the recruited and reinforced armies of these princes in the\
plains of Argaum, and again totally routed them, taking thirty-eight\
pieces of cannon. Without entering into further detail, it may be enough\
to say, that the whole campaign was a master-piece of courage and\
conduct, crowned with the most brilliant and decisive successes.\
\
\
St. XIX. l. 5.--_Of Leon and Castile._\
\
The national flag of Spain bears, per pale, Luna, a lion rampant,\
Saturn, for Leon; and Mars, a castle, Sol, for Castile.\
\
\
St. XIX. l. 8.--_To Wellesleys eyes as pervious as the air._\
\
The sagacity with which Sir A. Wellesley always foresaw the enemys\
point of attack, and prepared means of repelling it, was very\
remarkable. Those modest gentlemen in England, who undervalue his\
military abilities, are obliged, (though unintentionally I dare say,) to\
deny at the same time those of _their friends_ the French, who admit\
that the English position was excellently chosen, and obstinately\
defended: but indeed this admission was superfluous; for the\
perseverance with which they assailed it, sufficiently proves how\
important they thought it! Let it never be forgotten, that this\
position, five times at least attacked with more than double forces by\
some of the best generals and troops of France, was found to be\
impregnable. But what are the opinions of the French marshals, or even\
the evidence of facts, to the speculations of the tacticians of the\
Morning Chronicle.\
\
\
St. XIX. l. 12.--_Strong covert._\
\
\'The right, consisting of Spanish troops, extended immediately in front\
of the town of Talavera, down to the Tagus. This part of the ground was\
covered by olive-trees, and much intersected by banks and ditches. The\
high road leading from the bridge over the Alberche, was defended by a\
heavy battery, in front of a church, which was occupied by Spanish\
infantry. All the avenues to the town were defended in a similar manner;\
the town was occupied, and the remainder of the Spanish infantry was\
formed in two lines behind the banks on the roads which led from the\
town, and the right to the left of our position.----\
\
Sir A. Wellesleys dispatch.--_Gazette, Aug. 15, 1809._\
\
\
St. XIX. l. 18.--_Commanding height._\
\
Had the French succeeded in carrying that height on which General Hills\
brigade alone was at first posted, but towards which Sir Arthur\
afterwards moved several other regiments, nothing, it is thought, could\
have saved the British and Spanish armies from an entire defeat.\
\
\
St. XX. l. 8.--_Three columns._\
\
Many of the circumstances of this and the next Stanza are taken from an\
excellent letter from an officer of the 48th to his friend in Dublin,\
which was published in the Freemans Journal, of that city, of the 19th\
August, 1809.\
\
\
St. XXI. l. 7.--_As upon the sea-beat sand._\
\
The fair critic, (whom I have before mentioned as accusing me of\
borrowing from Tasso,) has discovered, that for this image I am indebted\
to Homer; and to this latter charge I believe I must plead guilty, as\
well as to the still greater offence of miserably deteriorating what I\
have stolen: but the first of these faults was unintentional, and I need\
scarcely say that the second was inevitable.\
\
              Iliad, XV. 362.\
\
\
St. XXI. l. 32.--_Langworth, and Albuquerque, and Payne._\
\
General Baron Langworth, (who unfortunately, but gloriously fell,)\
commanded the German cavalry. The duke of Albuquerque was of\
considerable service with his corps of Spanish horse, and Generals Payne\
and Anson commanded the British cavalry. These troops brought off the\
remains of the 23d dragoons, who, in a charge headed by Colonel Seymour,\
had gotten entangled in a ravine and deep ditches, and were in danger\
of being entirely destroyed.--They behaved with great gallantry, but\
suffered a considerable loss, having however had the satisfaction of\
baffling Victors (the duke of Belluno) attempt on General Hills\
position.\
\
\
St. XXII. XXIII. and XXIV.\
\
These three stanzas have been added since the seventh edition.--With the\
interesting circumstances which they attempt to describe, I was not\
acquainted when the poem was originally written. They were indeed, I\
believe, first made known to the public in a most impressive speech\
delivered in the House of Commons, early in the last session, by Lord\
Viscount Castlereagh; and I have only to regret, that I have not been\
more successful in my endeavour to preserve, in my stanzas, the interest\
and animation of his Lordships eloquent description. 1811.\
\
\
St. XXIII. l. 14.--_The Champion of Bivar._\
\
The famous Cid, Ruy Dias of Bivar, the Campeador.\
\
\
St. XXIV. l. 28.--_Grasp of manly hands._\
\
It is delightful to think that this incident, so interesting, and in\
modern times so unusual, is strictly true.\
\
\
St. XXV. l. 13.--_On the centre._\
\
The repulse of Victor by the dragoons was followed by a general attack\
on the centre and right of the British line, which was every where\
gallantly repulsed; but the action was severest towards the left of the\
centre, where General Sherbrook commanded: it was there that the gallant\
impetuosity of the Guards for a moment endangered the victory, and with\
the description of this principal attack the text is chiefly occupied.\
\
\
St. XXVIII. l. 18.--_The tide of victory turned._\
\
It is not to be denied, that at this moment the fate of the day was\
something worse than doubtful; but Sir Arthur, as soon as he saw the\
advance of the Guards, anticipated the result, and moved other troops\
(among the rest the 48th regiment) from the heights into the plain, to\
cover the retreat, which took place as he expected.\
\
\
St. XXVIII. l. last.--_Squanders himself away._\
\
See the note in Stanza VII. l. 14.--Towards the close of the action, Sir\
A. Wellesley was struck by two balls, (but without injury,) and two of\
his aid-de-camps were wounded at his side. On this occasion his personal\
exertions and peril seemed necessary to retrieve the victory.\
\
\
St. XXIX. l. 2.--_A gallant legion._\
\
The 48th regiment, by whose coolness and courage (and both were severely\
tried) the Guards were enabled to form again. Col. Donellan was\
unfortunately severely wounded at the head of this gallant corps. 1809.\
\
This wound was mortal. This good and gallant man now \'sleeps the slumber\
of the brave. 1810.\
\
\
St. XXX. l. 7.--_He vainly toils and dies._\
\
I have lately observed that this line is almost literally borrowed from\
a description of circumstances nearly similar in \'Marmion.\
\
      \'While yet on Flodden side,\
    \'Afar, the royal standard flies,\
    \'And round it toils, and bleeds, and dies,\
      \'Our Caledonian pride.--_Cant._ IV. _St._ XXXIII.\
\
I have so many other and greater obligations to the author of \'Marmion,\
that I should hardly have thought it worth while to notice this\
involuntary plagiarism, but that, by doing so, I obtain an opportunity\
of publicly acknowledging these obligations, and of expressing my\
humble, but most sincere admiration of the vigour, originality, and\
splendour, which distinguish, from all the other works of our day, the\
delightful poems of Mr. Scott.\
\
I have just noticed also, that the second line of the XIXth Stanza is\
copied verbatim from Marmion.\
\
\
St. XXXI. l. 5.--_Desolating fires._\
\
This circumstance is mentioned in private letters; but not that the\
French set fire to the field _designedly_:--it would rather seem that\
the accidental bursting of their shells in the dry grass occasioned this\
conflagration, which ravaged a great extent of ground, and entirely\
consumed many of the dead, and (horrid to relate!) some of the wounded.\
This must have been a new and striking feature of war.\
\
\
St. XXXIII. l. 14.--_France moves her busy bands._\
\
Immediately after the repulse of their general attack, the French began\
to retire; which they did in good order; and during the night effected\
their retreat towards Santa Olalla, leaving in the hands of the British\
20 pieces of cannon, ammunition, tumbrils, and prisoners.\
\
\
St. XXXIII. l. 18.--_Windy car._\
\
\'Ventoso gloria curru.\
\
\
St. XXXIII. l. 34.--_Glory of the day._\
\
If, says an eloquent writer in the Quarterly Review, we cherished, in\
_former_ circumstances of the war, a hope of the success of our efforts\
for the assistance of Spain, and of her final deliverance, \'We own we\
cannot consent to abandon it _now_, when such a day as that of Talavera\
has re-established, in its old and romantic proportion, the relative\
scale of British and French prowess; when an achievement, the recital of\
which is alone sufficient to shame despondency, and to give animation\
to hope, has not only inspired us with fresh confidence in ourselves,\
but, by infusing into our allies a portion of that confidence, has\

    _For those that die_\
      _In honours high career._\
\
I lament exceedingly that my plan and limits did not permit me to pay to\
those distinguished officers who fell in this action the tribute they\
individually deserved--but it is to be hoped that the Country will show\
its sense of their glorious services and fall by a public monument.\

St. XXXV.\
\
The authors brother died a few months before the publication of this\
poem, at the age of twenty-two; at the moment when he, who had ever been\
a source of happiness to his family, was become its ornament and\
support, and had just entered on public life, with (for a person of his\
level) the fairest prospects, and under the happiest auspices.\

NOTES.\

\
_WAR SONG.--Page 61._\
\
These stanzas were written and published at the breaking out of the\
present war, when, it will be recollected, the enemys threats of\
invasion were not altogether despised in this country. Some of my\
readers will possibly observe, that the style and metre of this trifle\
are not very dissimilar from those which have been more lately used by\
some popular writers. I have therefore thought it necessary to state\
that it was published early in 1803--but the truth is, that the practice\
of breaking the regular eight syllable verse into distichs or ternaries,\
by shorter lines, is very ancient in English poetry. The Chester\
Mysteries, written in 1328, exhibit this metre in a tolerably perfect\
state. After a long disuse, it is indebted for its revival and\
popularity to the good taste and extraordinary talents of Mr. Scott; and\
I cannot but think that it is, in his hands, one of the most harmonious\
and delightful of our English measures: to my ear, indeed, the\
versification of Marmion, in which Mr. Scott has used this style very\
freely, is more agreeable than that of the Lady of the Lake, in which he\
has employed it more sparingly. 1812.\
\
\
_II.--SONG OF TRAFALGAR.--Page 69._\
\
St. III. l. 4.--_Aboukirs Isle._\
\
The western point of Aboukir Bay is formed by an island, now called in\
our charts, Nelsons Island.\
\
On this island probably, and the adjoining peninsula, stood the ancient\
Canopus, both being, to this day, covered with ruins, supposed to be\
those of that celebrated city.\
\
This, I am inclined to think, is the Canopic Island known to all\
antiquity, and in later times called the Island Aboukir. (Eutychius,\
Ann. 2. 508.) This would account for the testimony given by Pliny,\
Strabo, &c. as to the insular situation of Canopus, and by Scylax, as to\
an island in the Canopic mouth, without having recourse to the\
supposition that the Isthmus, somewhere between Alexandria and Aboukir\
castle, had been covered by the sea, which indeed seems rather to have\
encroached upon, than receded from, that part of the coast.\
\
\
St. III. l. 7.--_St. Vincents towery steep._\
\
On the summit of St. Vincents, and close on the precipices which\
overhang the sea, is a convent, which gives the name of its patron to\
the Cape.\
\
\
_III.--SONG OF TRAFALGAR.--Page 73._\
\
St. II. l. 3.--_Twenty hostile ensigns low._\
\
Such was the statement of the London Gazette, of the 27th Nov. 1805;\
but in a subsequent number this was noticed as an error, there being, in\
fact, _but nineteen_ sail of the line taken or utterly destroyed. I have\
been assured by a gentleman who was at that period in Germany, that this\
instance of the scrupulous veracity of the British government produced\
an effect little less favourable to the British character than the news\
of the victory itself.\
\
I hope, however, that I may be forgiven for adhering to the first\
report, particularly as these lines were written on the day I first\
heard of the battle, and before the corrected statement came to my\
knowledge.\
\
It was a striking proof of Lord Nelsons almost miraculous sagacity,\
that just at the commencement of the action, he expressed his opinion\
that twenty sail of the enemy would be taken.\
\
\
St. XVI.\
\
    _Haul not your colour from on high,_\
      _Nor down the flags of victory lower:--_\
    _Give every streamer to the sky,_\
      _Let all your conquering cannon roar._\
\
\'If any flag-officer shall die in actual service, his flag shall be\
lowered half-mast, and shall continue so till he is buried; and at his\
funeral the commanding officer present shall direct such a number of\
minute-guns, not exceeding twenty-five, as he may think proper, to be\
fired by every ship.\
\
_Naval Instructions, chap. 2, sec. 26._\
\
These lines were written before the intentions of government as to the\
heros funeral were known, or probably had been fixed; but I could not\
refrain from expressing my hope that the usual cold and penurious\
ceremonies should not disgrace an occasion so infinitely removed from,\
and above all precedent; or that the grief of the navy and the nation\
should be directed by chapter and section, and attested by twenty-five\
minute-guns, and _no more_! After all, the funeral did no great credit\
to our national taste; and I could wish, that the only memorial of it\
which remains, I mean the pitiful and trumpery car on which the body was\
carried, were returned from the Painted Hall at Greenwich, which it\
disgraces, to the repository of the undertaker who built it. Shabby and\
tasteless as it originally was, it is now much worse; for whatever was\
costly about it has been removed, (particularly the plumes,) and cheap\
_second hand_ finery substituted instead. To this almost incredible\
meanness is added that of shewing this wretched vamped-up vehicle to the\
visitors at Greenwich at _threepence_ each!!!\
\
\
_IV.--SONG OF TRAFALGAR.--Page 79._\
\
Line 15.--_The worlds great victor._\
\
It is perhaps scarcely necessary to say, that I here allude to the\
famous visit of Alexander the Great to the tomb of Achilles.\
\
\
Line 34.\
\
    _Such let it be, as oer the bed_\
    _Of Nilus rears its lonely head._\
\
The famous pillar, commonly called Pompeys, but stated, with such\
ostentation of accuracy by all the French s\'e7avans, to have been erected\
in honour of Septimius Severus. The ingenuity and industry, however, of\
two British officers, Capt. Duncan, of the royal engineers, and Lieut.\
De Sade, of the Queens German regiment, have recovered the inscription\
on this celebrated column, which attests that it was erected and\
dedicated to Diocletian by Pontius, prefect of Egypt.\
\
\
Line 49.--_Thither shall youthful heroes climb._\
\
This and some other passages, (in these songs of Trafalgar,) so much\
resemble some thoughts in the vigorous and beautiful verses entitled,\
\'Ulm and Trafalgar, that it is necessary for me to say that the former\
were written and published in Ireland in Nov. 1805, and that it was not\
until a very considerable time after, that I had the pleasure of reading\
the latter, which were printed in London early, I believe, in 1806. I\
should also add, that I think it highly improbable that my little\
publication could have reached the author of \'Ulm and Trafalgar, before\
his poem appeared: so that whatever coincidence there may be is purely\
accidental. I cannot but confess that I have thought much the better of\
my own lines since I have discovered them to have any resemblance to\
his, though I am aware that upon every body else a contrary effect will\
be produced, and that nothing can be more unfavourable to me than any\
thing like a comparison between us.\
\
\
_DESPAIR OF SPAIN._\
\
Line 11.\
\
    _---- can thy scope_\
    _Nothing but danger see?_\
\
These verses were prompted by the indignation which I felt and feel at\
the _unbritish_ language of those who tremble, or affect to tremble, for\
the safety of England, who prophesy the subjugation of Spain, and\
trumpet forth the invincibility of Bonaparte. It may be weakness, it may\
be ignorance, which prompts such expressions;--it may be a sincere,\
though shameful conviction of the vanity of opposing France;--but,\
whatever be its source, such conduct appears to be a most potent\
auxiliary to the common enemy of Europe, and very little short of\
treason against the liberties of mankind. 1810.\
\
\
Line 16.--_Saragossa._\
\
The defence of this city, in 1809, by its gallant inhabitants, under\
their heroic leader, Don Josef Palafox, is one of the most splendid and\
extraordinary events of modern times; and if any one of my readers shall\
not have seen the narrative of the siege published by Mr. Vaughan, I\
cannot (though the subject is, in some degree, gone by) but recommend it\
to his perusal, as a valuable record \'of an event which teaches so\
forcibly the resources of patriotism and courage; and of an example\
which ought not to be lost to the world.\
\
\
Line 17.--_Heroes and saints._\
\
\'One character which developed itself during the siege of Zaragoza, must\
not be overlooked in this narrative. In every part of the town where the\
danger was most imminent, and the French the most numerous, was Padre\
St. Jago Sass, curate of a parish of Zaragoza. As General Palafox made\
his rounds through the city, he often beheld Sass alternately playing\
the part of a priest and a soldier; sometimes administering the\
sacrament to the dying, and at others fighting in the most determined\
manner against the enemies of his country: from his energy of character\
and uncommon bravery, the Commander in Chief reposed the utmost\
confidence in him during the siege; wherever any thing difficult or\
hazardous was to be done, Sass was selected for its execution; and the\
introduction of a supply of powder, so essentially necessary to the\
defence of the town, was effected in the most complete manner by this\
clergyman, at the head of forty of the bravest men in Zaragoza. He was\
found so serviceable in inspiring the people with religious sentiments,\
and in leading them on to danger, that the general has placed him in a\
situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful\
as before; and he is now both captain in the army, and chaplain to the\
Commander in Chief.\

_It may be some apology for the imperfections of this Poem, that it was\

\
THE\
\
FIELD OF WATERLOO.\
\
\
    Fair Brussels, thou art far behind,\
    Though, lingering on the morning wind,\
        We yet may hear the hour\
    Peald over orchard and canal,\
    With voice prolongd and measured fall,\
        From proud Saint Michaels tower.\
    Thy wood, dark Soignies, holds us now,\
    Where the tall beeches glossy bough\
        For many a league around,\
    With birch and darksome oak between,\
    Spreads deep and far a pathless screen,\
        Of tangled forest ground.\
    Stems planted close by stems defy\
    The adventurous foot--the curious eye\
        For access seeks in vain;\
    And the brown tapestry of leaves,\
    Strewd on the blighted ground, receives\
        Nor sun, nor air, nor rain.\
    No opening glade dawns on our way,\
    No streamlet, glancing to the ray,\
        Our woodland path has crossd;\
    And the straight causeway which we tread,\
    Prolongs a line of dull arcade,\
    Unvarying through the unvaried shade\
        Until in distance lost.\
\
\
               II.\
\
    A brighter, livelier scene succeeds;\
    In groupes the scattering wood recedes,\
    Hedge-rows, and huts, and sunny meads,\
        And corn-fields glance between;\
    The peasant, at his labour blithe,\
    Plies the hookd staff and shortend scythe:--\
        But when these ears were green,\
    Placed close within destructions scope,\
    Full little was that rustics hope\
        Their ripening to have seen!\
    And, lo, a hamlet and its fane:--\
    Let not the gazer with disdain\
        Their architecture view;\
    For yonder rude ungraceful shrine,\
    And disproportiond spire, are thine,\
        Immortal WATERLOO!\
\
\
               III.\
\
    Fear not the heat, though full and high\
    The sun has scorchd the autumn sky,\
    And scarce a forest straggler now\
    To shade us spreads a greenwood bough\
    These fields have seen a hotter day\
    Than eer was fired by sunny ray.\
    Yet one mile on--yon shatterd hedge\
    Crests the soft hill whose long smooth ridge\
        Looks on the field below,\
    And sinks so gently on the dale,\
    That not the folds of Beautys veil\
        In easier curves can flow.\
    Brief space from thence, the ground again\
    Ascending slowly from the plain,\
        Forms an opposing screen,\
    Which, with its crest of upland ground,\
    Shuts the horizon all around.\
        The softend vale between\
    Slopes smooth and fair for coursers tread;\
    Not the most timid maid need dread\
    To give her snow-white palfrey head\
        On that wide stubble-ground;\
    Nor wood, nor tree, nor bush are there,\
    Her course to intercept or scare,\
        Nor fosse nor fence are found,\
    Save where, from out her shatterd bowers,\
    Rise Hougoumonts dismantled towers.\
\
\
               IV.\
\
    Now, seest thou aught in this lone scene\
    Can tell of that which late hath been?--\
        A stranger might reply,\
    \'The bare extent of stubble-plain\
    Seems lately lightend of its grain;\
    And yonder sable tracks remain\
    Marks of the peasants ponderous wain,\
        When harvest-home was nigh.\
    On these broad spots of trampled ground,\
    Perchance the rustics danced such round\
        As Teniers loved to draw;\
    And where the earth seems scorchd by flame,\
    To dress the homely feast they came,\
    And toild the kerchiefd village dame\
        Around her fire of straw.\'--\
\
\
               V.\
\
    So deemst thou--so each mortal deems,\
    Of that which is from that which seems:--\
        But other harvest here\
    Than that which peasants scythe demands,\
    Was gatherd in by sterner hands,\
        With bayonet, blade, and spear.\
    No vulgar crop was theirs to reap,\
    No stinted harvest thin and cheap!\
    Heroes before each fatal sweep\
        Fell thick as ripend grain;\
    And ere the darkening of the day,\
    Piled high as autumn shocks, there lay\
    The ghastly harvest of the fray,\
        The corpses of the slain.\
\
\
               VI.\
\
    Aye, look again--that line so black\
    And trampled, marks the bivouack,\
    Yon deep-graved ruts the artillerys track,\
        So often lost and won\
    And close beside, the hardend mud\
    Still shows where, fetlock-deep in blood,\
    The fierce dragoon, through battles flood,\
        Dashd the hot war-horse on.\
    These spots of excavation tell\
    The ravage of the bursting shell--\
    And feelst thou not the tainted steam,\
    That reeks against the sultry beam,\
        From yonder trenched mound?\
    The pestilential fumes declare\
    That Carnage has replenishd there\
        Her garner-house profound.\
\
\
               VII.\
\
    Far other harvest-home and feast,\
    Than claims the boor from scythe released,\
        On these scorchd fields were known!\
    Death hoverd oer the maddening rout,\
    And, in the thrilling battle-shout,\
    Sent for the bloody banquet out\
        A summons of his own.\
    Through rolling smoke the Demons eye\
    Could well each destined guest espy,\
    Well could his ear in ecstacy\
        Distinguish every tone\
    That filld the chorus of the fray--\
    From cannon-roar and trumpet-bray,\
    From charging squadrons wild hurra,\
    From the wild clang that markd their way,--\
        Down to the dying groan,\
    And the last sob of lifes decay\
        When breath was all but flown.\
\
\
               VIII.\
\
    Feast on, stern foe of mortal life,\
    Feast on!--but think not that a strife,\
    With such promiscuous carnage rife,\
        Protracted space may last;\
    The deadly tug of war at length\
    Must limits find in human strength,\
        And cease when these are passd.\
    Vain hope!--that morns oerclouded sun\
    Heard the wild shout of fight begun\
        Ere he attaind his height,\
    And through the war-smoke volumed high,\
    Still peals that unremitted cry,\
        Though now he stoops to night.\
    For ten long hours of doubt and dread,\
    Fresh succours from the extended head\
    Of either hill the contest fed;\
        Still down the slope they drew,\
    The charge of columns paused not,\
    Nor ceased the storm of shell and shot;\
        For all that war could do\
    Of skill and force was proved that day,\
    And turnd not yet the doubtful fray\
        On bloody Waterloo.\
\
\
               IX.\
\
    Pale Brussels! then what thoughts were thine,\
    When ceaseless from the distant line\
        Continued thunders came!\
    Each burgher held his breath, to hear\
    These forerunners of havock near,\
        Of rapine and of flame.\
    What ghastly sights were thine to meet,\
    When, rolling through thy stately street,\
    The wounded shewd their mangled plight\
    In token of the unfinishd fight,\
    And from each anguish-laden wain\
    The blood-drops laid thy dust like rain!\
    How often in the distant drum\
    Heardst thou the fell Invader come,\
    While Ruin, shouting to his band,\
    Shook high her torch and gory brand!--\
    Cheer thee, fair City! From yon stand,\
    Impatient, still his outstretchd hand\
        Points to his prey in vain,\
    While maddening in his eager mood,\
    And all unwont to be withstood,\
        He fires the fight again.\
\
\
               X.\
\
    \'On! On!\' was still his stern exclaim;\
    \'Confront the batterys jaws of flame!\
        \'Rush on the levelld gun!\
    \'My steel-clad cuirassiers, advance!\
    \'Each Hulan forward with his lance,\
    \'My Guard--my chosen--charge for France,\
        \'France and Napoleon!\'\
    Loud answerd their acclaiming shout,\
    Greeting the mandate which sent out\
    Their bravest and their best to dare\
    The fate their leader shunnd to share.\
    But He, his countrys sword and shield,\
    Still in the battle-front reveald,\
    Where danger fiercest swept the field,\
        Came like a beam of light,\
    In action prompt, in sentence brief--\
    \'Soldiers, stand firm,\' exclaimd the Chief,\
        \'England shall tell the fight!\'\
\
\
               XI.\
\
    On came the whirlwind--like the last\
    But fiercest sweep of tempest blast--\
    On came the whirlwind--steel-gleams broke\
    Like lightning through the rolling smoke,\
        The war was waked anew,\
    Three hundred cannon-mouths roard loud,\
    And from their throats, with flash and cloud,\
        Their showers of iron threw.\
    Beneath their fire, in full career,\
    Rushd on the ponderous cuirassier,\
    The lancer couchd his ruthless spear,\
    And hurrying as to havock near,\
        The Cohorts eagles flew.\
    In one dark torrent broad and strong,\
    The advancing onset rolld along,\
    Forth harbingerd by fierce acclaim,\
    That, from the shroud of smoke and flame,\
    Peald wildly the imperial name.\
\
\
               XII.\
\
    But on the British heart were lost\
    The terrors of the charging host;\
    For not an eye the storm that viewd\
    Changed its proud glance of fortitude,\
    Nor was one forward footstep staid,\
    As droppd the dying and the dead.\
    Fast as their ranks the thunders tear,\
    Fast they renewd each serried square;\
    And on the wounded and the slain\
    Closed their diminishd files again,\
    Till from their line scarce spears lengths three,\
    Emerging from the smoke they see\
    Helmet and plume and panoply,--\
        Then waked their fire at once!\
    Each musketeers revolving knell,\
    As fast, as regularly fell,\
    As when they practise to display\
    Their discipline on festal day.\
        Then down went helm and lance,\
    Down were the eagle banners sent,\
    Down reeling steeds and riders went,\
    Corslets were pierced, and pennons rent;\
        And to augment the fray,\
    Wheeld full against their staggering flanks,\
    The English horsemens foaming ranks\
        Forced their resistless way.\
    Then to the musket-knell succeeds\
    The clash of swords--the neigh of steeds--\
    As plies the smith his clanging trade,\
    Against the cuirass rang the blade;\
    And while amid their close array\
    The well-served cannon rent their way,\
    And while amid their scatterd band\
    Raged the fierce riders bloody brand,\
    Recoild in common rout and fear,\
    Lancer and guard and cuirassier,\
    Horsemen and foot,--a mingled host,\
    Their leaders fallen, their standards lost.\
\
\
               XIII.\
\
    Then, WELLINGTON! thy piercing eye\
    This crisis caught of destiny--\
        The British host had stood\
    That morn gainst charge of sword and lance\
    As their own ocean-rocks hold stance,\
    But when thy voice had said, \'Advance!\'\
        They were their oceans flood.--\
    O Thou, whose inauspicious aim\
    Hath wrought thy host this hour of shame,\
    Thinkst thou thy broken bands will bide\
    The terrors of yon rushing tide?\
    Or will thy Chosen brook to feel\
    The British shock of levelld steel?\
        Or dost thou turn thine eye\
    Where coming squadrons gleam afar,\
    And fresher thunders wake the war,\
        And other standards fly?--\
    Think not that in yon columns, file\
    Thy conquering troops from distant Dyle--\
        Is Blucher yet unknown?\
    Or dwells not in thy memory still,\
    (Heard frequent in thine hour of ill)\
    What notes of hate and vengeance thrill\
        In Prussias trumpet tone?--\
    What yet remains?--shall it be thine\
    To head the reliques of thy line\
        In one dread effort more?--\
    The Roman lore thy leisure loved,\
    And thou canst tell what fortune proved\
        That Chieftain, who, of yore,\
    Ambitions dizzy paths essayd,\
    And with the gladiators aid\
        For empire enterprized--\
    He stood the cast his rashness playd,\
    Left not the victims he had made,\
    Dug his red grave with his own blade,\
    And on the field he lost was laid,\
        Abhorrd--but not despised.\
\
\
               XIV.\
\
    But if revolves thy fainter thought\
    On safety--howsoever bought,\
    Then turn thy fearful rein and ride,\
    Though twice ten thousand men have died\
        On this eventful day,\
    To gild the military fame\
    Which thou, for life, in traffic tame\
        Wilt barter thus away.\
    Shall future ages tell this tale\
    Of inconsistence faint and frail?\
    And art thou He of Lodis bridge,\
    Marengos field, and Wagrams ridge!\
        Or is thy soul like mountain-tide,\
    That, swelld by winter storm and shower,\
    Rolls down in turbulence of power\
        A torrent fierce and wide;\
    Reft of these aids, a rill obscure,\
    Shrinking unnoticed, mean, and poor,\
        Whose channel shows displayd\
    The wrecks of its impetuous course,\
    But not one symptom of the force\
        By which these wrecks were made!\
\
\
               XV.\
\
    Spur on thy way!--since now thine ear\
    Has brookd thy veterans wish to hear,\
        Who, as thy flight they eyed,\
    Exclaimed,--while tears of anguish came,\
    Wrung forth by pride and rage and shame,--\
        \'Oh that he had but died!\'\
    But yet, to sum this hour of ill,\
    Look, ere thou leavst the fatal hill,\
        Back on yon broken ranks--\
    Upon whose wild confusion gleams\
    The moon, as on the troubled streams\
        When rivers break their banks,\
    And, to the ruind peasants eye,\
    Objects half seen roll swiftly by,\
        Down the dread current hurld--\
    So mingle banner, wain, and gun,\
    Where the tumultuous flight rolls on\
    Of warriors, who, when morn begun,\
        Defied a banded world.\
\
\
               XVI.\
\
    List--frequent to the hurrying rout,\
    The stern pursuers vengeful shout\
    Tells, that upon their broken rear\
    Rages the Prussians bloody spear.\
        So fell a shriek was none,\
    When Beresinas icy flood\
    Reddend and thawd with flame and blood,\
    And, pressing on thy desperate way,\
    Raised oft and long their wild hurra,\
        The children of the Don.\
    Thine ear no yell of horror cleft\
    So ominous, when, all bereft\
    Of aid, the valiant Polack left--\
    Aye, left by thee--found soldiers grave\
    In Leipsics corpse-encumberd wave.\
    Fate, in these various perils past,\
    Reserved thee still some future cast:--\
    On the dread die thou now hast thrown,\
    Hangs not a single field alone,\
    Nor one campaign--thy martial fame,\
    Thy empire, dynasty, and name,\
        Have felt the final stroke;\
    And now, oer thy devoted head\
    The last stern vials wrath is shed,\
        The last dread seal is broke.\
\
\
               XVII.\
\
    Since live thou wilt--refuse not now\
    Before these demagogues to bow,\
    Late objects of thy scorn and hate,\
    Who shall thy once imperial fate\
    Make wordy theme of vain debate.--\
    Or shall we say, thou stoopst less low\
    In seeking refuge from the foe,\
    Against whose heart, in prosperous life,\
    Thine hand hath ever held the knife?--\
        Such homage hath been paid\
    By Roman and by Grecian voice,\
    And there were honour in the choice,\
        If it were freely made.\
    Then safely come--in one so low,--\
    So lost,--we cannot own a foe;\
    Though dear experience bid us end,\
    In thee we neer can hail a friend.--\
    Come, howsoeer--but do not hide\
    Close in thy heart that germ of pride,\
    Erewhile by gifted bard espied,\
        That \'yet imperial hope;\'\
    Think not that for a fresh rebound,\
    To raise ambition from the ground,\
        We yield thee means or scope.\
    In safety come--but neer again\
    Hold type of independent reign;\
        No islet calls thee lord,\
    We leave thee no confederate band,\
    No symbol of thy lost command,\
    To be a dagger in the hand\
        From which we wrenchd the sword.\
\
\
               XVIII.\
\
    Yet, even in yon sequesterd spot,\
    May worthier conquest be thy lot\
        Than yet thy life has known;\
    Conquest, unbought by blood or harm,\
    That needs nor foreign aid nor arm,\
        A triumph all thine own.\
    Such waits thee when thou shalt controul\
    Those passions wild, that stubborn soul,\
        That marrd thy prosperous scene:--\
    Hear this--from no unmoved heart,\
    Which sighs, comparing what THOU ART\
        With what thou MIGHTST HAVE BEEN!\
\
\
               XIX.\
\
    Thou, too, whose deeds of fame renewd\
    Bankrupt a nations gratitude,\
    To thine own noble heart must owe\
    More than the meed she can bestow.\
    For not a peoples just acclaim,\
    Not the full hail of Europes fame,\
    Thy princes smiles, thy states decree,\
    The ducal rank, the garterd knee,\
    Not these such pure delight afford\
    As that, when, hanging up thy sword,\
    Well mayst thou think, \'This honest steel\
    Was ever drawn for public weal;\
    And, such was rightful Heavens decree,\
    Neer sheathed unless with victory!\'\
\
\
               XX.\
\
    Look forth, once more, with softend heart,\
    Ere from the field of fame we part;\
    Triumph and Sorrow border near,\
    And joy oft melts into a tear.\
    Alas! what links of love that morn\
    Has Wars rude hand asunder torn!\
    For neer was field so sternly fought,\
    And neer was conquest dearer bought.\
    Here piled in common slaughter sleep\
    Those whom affection long shall weep;\
    Here rests the sire, that neer shall strain\
    His orphans to his heart again;\
    The son, whom, on his native shore,\
    The parents voice shall bless no more;\
    The bridegroom, who has hardly pressd\
    His blushing consort to his breast;\
    The husband, whom through many a year\
    Long love and mutual faith endear.\
    Thou canst not name one tender tie\
    But here dissolved its reliques lie!\
    O when thou seest some mourners veil,\
    Shroud her thin form and visage pale,\
    Or markst the Matrons bursting tears\
    Stream when the stricken drum she hears;\
    Or seest how manlier grief, suppressd,\
    Is labouring in a fathers breast,--\
    With no enquiry vain pursue\
    The cause, but think on Waterloo!\
\
\
               XXI.\
\
    Period of honour as of woes,\
    What bright careers twas thine to close!--\
    Markd on thy roll of blood what names\
    To Britains memory, and to Fames,\
    Laid there their last immortal claims!\
    Thou sawst in seas of gore expire\
    Redoubted PICTONS soul of fire--\
    Sawst in the mingled carnage lie\
    All that of PONSONBY could die--\
    DE LANCY change Loves bridal-wreath,\
    For laurels from the hand of Death--\
    Sawst gallant MILLERS failing eye\
    Still bent where Albions banners fly,\
    And CAMERON, in the shock of steel,\
    Die like the offspring of Lochiel;\
    And generous GORDON, mid the strife,\
    Fall while he watchd his leaders life.--\
    Ah! though her guardian angels shield\
    Fenced Britains hero through the field,\
    Fate not the less her power made known,\
    Through his friends hearts to pierce his own!\

\
               XXII.\
\
    Forgive, brave Dead, the imperfect lay!\
    Who may your names, your numbers, say?\
    What high-strung harp, what lofty line,\
    To each the dear-earnd praise assign,\
    From high-born chiefs of martial fame\
    To the poor soldiers lowlier name?\
    Lightly ye rose that dawning day,\
    From your cold couch of swamp and clay,\
    To fill, before the sun was low,\
    The bed that morning cannot know.--\
    Oft may the tear the green sod steep,\
    And sacred be the heroes sleep,\
        Till Time shall cease to run\
    And neer beside their noble grave,\
    May Briton pass and fail to crave\
    A blessing on the fallen brave\
        Who fought with Wellington!\
\
\
               XXIII.\
\
    Farewell, sad Field! whose blighted face\
    Wears desolations withering trace;\
    Long shall my memory retain\
    Thy shatterd huts and trampled grain,\
    With every mark of martial wrong,\
    That scathe thy towers, fair Hougomont!\
    Yet though thy gardens green arcade\
    The marksmans fatal post was made,\
    Though on thy shatterd beeches fell\
    The blended rage of shot and shell,\
    Though from thy blackend portals torn\
    Their fall thy blighted fruit-trees mourn,\
    Has not such havock bought a name\
    Immortal in the rolls of fame?\
    Yes--Agincourt may be forgot,\
    And Cressy be an unknown spot,\
        And Blenheims name be new;\
    But still in story and in song,\
    For many an age rememberd long,\
    Shall live the towers of Hougomont,\
        And fields of Waterloo.\

\
CONCLUSION.\
\
\
      Stern tide of human Time! that knowst not rest,\
        But, sweeping from the cradle to the tomb,\
      Bearst ever downward on thy dusky breast\
        Successive generations to their doom;\
      While thy capacious stream has equal room\
        For the gay bark where Pleasures streamers sport,\
      And for the prison-ship of guilt and gloom,\
        The fisher-skiff, and barge that bears a court,\
    Still wafting onward all to one dark silent port.\
\
      Stern tide of Time! through what mysterious change\
        Of hope and fear have our frail barks been driven!\
      For neer, before, vicissitude so strange\
        Was to one race of Adams offspring given.\
      And sure such varied change of sea and heaven,\
        Such unexpected bursts of joy and woe,\
      Such fearful strife as that where we have striven,\
        Succeeding ages neer again shall know,\
    Until the awful term when Thou shalt cease to flow.\
\
      Well hast thou stood, my Country!--the brave fight\
        Hast well maintaind through good report and ill;\
      In thy just cause and in thy native might,\
        And in Heavens grace and justice constant still.\
      Whether the banded prowess, strength, and skill\
        Of half the world against thee stood arrayd,\
      Or when, with better views and freer will,\
        Beside thee Europes noblest drew the blade,\
    Each emulous in arms the Ocean Queen to aid.\
\
      Well art thou now repaid--though slowly rose,\
        And struggled long with mists thy blaze of fame,\
      While like the dawn that in the orient glows\
        On the broad wave its earlier lustre came;\
      Then eastern Egypt saw the growing flame,\
        And Maidas myrtles gleamd beneath its ray,\
      Where first the soldier, stung with generous shame,\
        Rivalld the heroes of the watry way,\
    And washd in foemens gore unjust reproach away.\
\
      Now, Island Empress, wave thy crest on high,\
        And bid the banner of thy Patron flow,\
      Gallant Saint George, the flower of Chivalry!\
        For thou hast faced, like him, a dragon foe,\
      And rescued innocence from overthrow,\
        And trampled down, like him, tyrannic might,\
      And to the gazing world mayst proudly show\
        The chosen emblem of thy sainted Knight,\
    Who quelld devouring pride, and vindicated right.\
      Yet mid the confidence of just renown,\
        Renown dear-bought, but dearest thus acquired,\
      Write, Britain, write the moral lesson down:\
        Tis not alone the heart with valour fired,\
      The discipline so dreaded and admired,\
        In many a field of bloody conquest known;\
    --Such may by fame be lured, by gold be hired--\
        Tis constancy in the good cause alone,\
    Best justifies the meed thy valiant sons have won.\

\
    _The peasant, at his labour blithe,_\
    _Plies the hookd staff and shortend scythe._--P. 195.\
\
The reaper in Flanders carries in his left hand a stick with an iron\
hook, with which he collects as much grain as he can cut at one sweep\
with a short scythe, which he holds in his right hand. They carry on\
this double process with great spirit and dexterity.\

\
_Pale Brussels! then what thoughts were thine._--P. 203.\

It was affirmed by the prisoners of war, that Buonaparte had promised\
his army, in case of victory, twenty-four hours plunder of the city of\
Brussels.\

\
The characteristic obstinacy of Napoleon was never more fully displayed\
than in what we may be permitted to hope will prove the last of his\
fields. He would listen to no advice, and allow of no obstacles. An\
eye-witness has given the following account of his demeanour towards the\
end of the action:--\
\
\'It was near seven oclock; Buonaparte, who, till then, had remained\
upon the ridge of the hill whence he could best behold what passed,\
contemplated, with a stern countenance, the scene of this horrible\
slaughter. The more that obstacles seemed to multiply, the more his\
obstinacy seemed to increase. He became indignant at these unforeseen\
difficulties; and, far from fearing to push to extremities an army whose\
confidence in him was boundless, he ceased not to pour down fresh\
troops, and to give orders to march forward--to charge with the\
bayonet--to carry by storm. He was repeatedly informed, from different\
points, that the day went against him, and that the troops seemed to be\
disordered; to which he only replied,--\'_En avant! en avant!_\
\
\'One general sent to inform the Emperor that he was in a position which\
he could not maintain, because it was commanded by a battery, and\
requested to know, at the same time, in what way he should protect his\
division from the murderous fire of the English artillery. \'Let him\
storm the battery, replied Buonaparte, and turned his back on the\
aid-de-camp who brought the message.\'--_Relation de la Bataille de\
Mont-Saint-Jean. Par un Temoin Occulaire._ Paris, 1815, 8vo. p. 51.\
\
\
Note IV.\
\
_The fate their leader shunnd to share._--P. 205.\
\
It has been reported that Buonaparte charged at the head of his guards\
at the last period of this dreadful conflict. This, however, is not\
accurate. He came down, indeed, to a hollow part of the high road\
leading to Charleroi, within less than a quarter of a mile of the farm\
of La Haye Sainte, one of the points most fiercely disputed. Here he\
harangued the guards, and informed them that his preceding operations\
had destroyed the British infantry and cavalry, and that they had only\
to support the fire of the artillery, which they were to attack with the\
bayonet. This exhortation was received with shouts of _Vive lEmpereur_,\
which were heard over all our line, and led to an idea that Napoleon was\
charging in person. But the guards were led on by Ney; nor did\
Buonaparte approach nearer the scene of action than the spot already\
mentioned, which the rising banks on each side rendered secure from all\
such balls as did not come in a straight line. He witnessed the earlier\
part of the battle from places yet more remote, particularly from an\
observatory which had been placed there by the king of the Netherlands,\
some weeks before, for the purpose of surveying the country.[3] It is\
not meant to infer from these particulars that Napoleon shewed, on that\
memorable occasion, the least deficiency in personal courage; on the\
contrary, he evinced the greatest composure and presence of mind during\
the whole action. But it is no less true that report has erred in\
ascribing to him any desperate efforts of valour for recovery of the\
battle; and it is remarkable, that during the whole carnage, none of his\
suite were either killed or wounded, whereas scarcely one of the Duke of\
Wellingtons personal attendants escaped unhurt.\
\
\
Note V.\
\
_England shall tell the fight._--P. 205.\
\
In riding up to a regiment which was hard pressed, the Duke called to\
the men, \'Soldiers, we must never be beat,--what will they say in\
England?\' It is needless to say how this appeal was answered.\
\
\
Note VI.\
\
    _As plies the smith his clanging trade,_\
    _Against the cuirass rang the blade._--P. 208.\
\
A private soldier of the 95th regiment compared the sound which took\
place immediately upon the British cavalry mingling with those of the\
enemy, to \'_a thousand tinkers at work mending pots and kettles_.\'\
\
\
Note VII.\
\
    _Or will thy Chosen brook to feel_\
    _The British shock of levelld steel._--P. 210.\
\
No persuasion or authority could prevail upon the French troops to stand\
the shock of the bayonet. The imperial guards, in particular, hardly\
stood till the British were within thirty yards of them, although the\
French author, already quoted, has put into their mouths the magnanimous\
sentiment, \'The guards never yield--they die.\' The same author has\
covered the plateau, or eminence, of St Jean, which formed the British\
position, with redoubts and entrenchments which never had an existence.\
As the narrative, which is in many respects curious, was written by an\
eye-witness, he was probably deceived by the appearance of a road and\
ditch which runs along part of the hill. It may be also mentioned, in\
criticising this work, that the writer states the Chateau of Hougomont\
to have been carried by the French, although it was resolutely and\
successfully defended during the whole action. The enemy, indeed,\
possessed themselves of the wood by which it is surrounded, and at\
length set fire to the house itself; but the British (a detachment of\
the Guards, under the command of Colonel Macdonnell, and afterwards of\
Colonel Home,) made good the garden, and thus preserved, by their\
desperate resistance, the post which covered the return of the Duke of\
Wellingtons right flank.\

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no\
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,\
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to\
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to\
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project\
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you\
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you\
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the\
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose\
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and\
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do\
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is\
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial\
redistribution.\

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE\
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK\
\
To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free\
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work\
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project\
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project\
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at\

\
\
Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm\
electronic works\
\
1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm\
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to\
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property\
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all\
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy\
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.\
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project\
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the\
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or\
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.\
\
1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be\
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who\
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few\
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See\
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project\
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement\
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.\
\
1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"\
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project\
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the\
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an\
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are\
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from\
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative\
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg\
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project\
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by\
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of\
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with\
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by\
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project\
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.\
\
1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern\
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in\
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check\
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement\
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or\
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project\
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning\
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United\
States.\
\
1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:\
\
1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate\
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently\
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the\

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,\
copied or distributed:\

almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or\
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included\
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license\
\
1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived\
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is\
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied\
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees\
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work\
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the\
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1\
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the\
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or\
1.E.9.\
\
1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted\
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution\
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional\
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked\
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the\
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.\
\
1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm\
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this\
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.\
\
1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this\
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without\
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with\
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project\
Gutenberg-tm License.\
\
1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,\
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any\
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or\
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than\
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version\
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),\
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a\
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon\
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other\
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm\
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.\
\
1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,\
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works\

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method\
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is\
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he\
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the\
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments\
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you\
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax\
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and\
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the\
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to\
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."\
\
- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies\
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he\
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm\
     License.  You must require such a user to return or\
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium\
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of\
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.\
\
- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any\
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the\
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days\
     of receipt of the work.\
\
- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free\
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.\
\
1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm\
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set\
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from\
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael\
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the\
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.\
\
1.F.\
\
1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable\
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread\
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm\
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain\
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or\
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual\
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a\
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by\
your equipment.\
\
1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right\
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project\
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project\
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project\
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all\
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal\
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT\
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE\
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE\
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE\
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR\
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\
DAMAGE.\
\
1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a\
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can\
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a\
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you\
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with\
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with\
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a\
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity\
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to\
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy\
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further\
opportunities to fix the problem.\
\
1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth\
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER\
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO\
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.\
\
1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied\
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.\
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the\
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be\
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by\
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any\
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.\
\
1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the\
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone\
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance\
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,\
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,\
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,\
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do\
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm\
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any\
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.\
\
\
Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\
\
Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\
people in all walks of life.\
\
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\

\
Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\
Literary Archive Foundation\
\
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\
status with the IRS.\
\
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\
particular state visit http://pglaf.org\
\
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\
approach us with offers to donate.\
\
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\
\
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\
\
\
Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\
works.\
\
Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\
\
\
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\
\
\
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\
\
     http://www.gutenberg.org\
\
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\
