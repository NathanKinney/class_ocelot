                <h3>The Rule of Thirds</h3>
                <p>The Rule of Thirds has been used since humans first started creating visual objects. For some reason, the human eye is attracted to things that are divided into a grid, and placing things on lines created by this grid nearly always creates a balanced, visually interesting layout.
                </p>
                <p>The same is true of Aquascaping. Let's take a look at a sample layout: which is a great example of how to aquascape!
                </p>
                <p><img src="http://www.aquascapeaddiction.com/assets/images/aquascaping-style.jpg" alt="Aqua scape demonstrating 1/3s">

                    What's immediately apparent are two things: this guy is good at carpeting plants, and this tank is definitely composed according to the Rule of Thirds.

                <h3>Focal Point Placement</h3>
                <p>We'll cover this in-depth later, but I want you to notice the placement of the highest part of the tank: It's placed almost exactly one-third away from the right side. That wasn't an accident. Whether intentional or subconsciously, the aquascaper found that to be a pleasing location for the focal point.
                </p>
                <p>Now that you're looking for it, you'll notice it in almost every tank you see. Focal points keep your layout from becoming to busy or distracting. In most cases,<strong> less is more</strong>. In many aquascaping styles, focal points are naturally created by following the style's guidelines. The Iwagumi style, for example, uses multiples of stones placed in a certain pattern, with a central stone being placed on one of the third-lines of the tank. This (by design) creates a focal point according to the Rule of Thirds. When it comes to your hardscape, when in doubt, don't add, but take away. This ensures that your tank has a striking visual aspect, and guides the viewer's eye across your tank. Focal points can be created through the effective use of plant selection, by either color, scale, or texture.
                </p>
                <h3>Plant Selection</h3>
                <p>It's important to keep in mind the plant's adult size & coloration. Choose a plant that's appropriately sized for where you're placing it. (We really like this plant pack, it has 25+ stems from 6 species). For example, in most cases, you wouldn't put a stem plant in the foreground, since it's likely to grow so tall that it blocks the view of the tank. You also wouldn't put a low-growing, carpeting plant in the back behind your aquascape. There wouldn't be a point, because it would never be seen.
