            <p>Gabe Logan Newell, born November 3, 1962, often nicknamed Gaben, is an American computer programmer and
                businessman best known as the co-founder of the video game development and digital distribution company Valve
                Corporation. Born in Seattle, Newell attended Harvard University in the early 1980s, but dropped out shortly
                before graduating and soon went to work for the American technology company Microsoft, where he spent the next
                decade working as a producer for some of their early Windows operating systems.

            <div>"In 2007, Newell openly expressed his displeasure over developing his software for gaming consoles,
                particularly the PlayStation 3. In regard to the system, Newell was once quoted as claiming that developing
                processes for the console in general was "a waste of everybody's time", "a disaster on many levels ... I'd say,
                even at this late date, they should just cancel it and do a do over. Just say, 'This was a horrible disaster and
                we're sorry and we're going to stop selling this and stop trying to convince people to develop for it'."
