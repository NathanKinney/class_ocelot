And you can scroll down to go through all of it. You just have to add a sufficient amount of text to make the scrollbars show. Obviously, this is not enough,o let’s assume we have a little more to say. Eventually, the scrollbars will come in handy. That’s it! :)</div>



Gabe Logan Newell, born November 3, 1962, often nicknamed Gaben, is an American computer programmer and
                businessman best known as the co-founder of the video game development and digital distribution company Valve
                Corporation. Born in Seattle, Newell attended Harvard University in the early 1980s, but dropped out shortly
                before graduating and soon went to work for the American technology company Microsoft, where he spent the next
                decade working as a producer for some of their early Windows operating systems.

                During his time at Microsoft, Newell, along with fellow co-worker Mike Harrington, were impressed by computer
                games that were being released in the mid-1990s, such as id Software's Doom and Quake. Fully convinced that
                video games were the future of entertainment, and intrigued by the prospect of having his own game development
                studio, Newell, along with Harrington, left Microsoft to co-found Valve in 1996, where he remains its
                president."
