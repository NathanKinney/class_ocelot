# functions ---------------------------

# return true if there are any underscores, false otherwise
# def check_underscores(letters):

# def load_words(): return a list of words


# take two lists - one of underscores and one of letters, and a letter
# try to replace the underscores with the matching letters
# if it does replace something, return true, otherwise return false






# steps to take ------------------------------------------------------

# open english.txt, have a minimum length of the word
# put all the words into a list
# randomly pick a word out of that list




# make the word into a list
# make a list of of underscores, same length as the word
# start a counter at 0




# ask for a letter, store in a variable
# check to see if the letter has been guessed before
    # if it has, we don't try it, tell the user, express snarkiness
# find the letter in the list of letters for the word
# replace the element in the underscore list with the same letter
# if we don't find it, increment the number of mistakes, display the hangman

# ['a', 'a', 'r', 'd']
# ['_', '_', '_', ...]

# if the mistake counter is 0, you lose
# if there aren't any underscores in the underscore list









# use pychalk?
